Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru.

Ultra wide pics are good too! Best video camera ever in a phone.- Great battery backup. Lasts me a day. 1 hr gaming.

Well its not an OLED! But still decent enough. Decent to look at. You wont feel its bad but its not great!- Front camera is average. Doesnt have a night mode. And the images are decent but not great again. Front wide angle is a joke.- 5W charger in box! Apple, I cannot hate you enough for this.

Even though my iphone 8 is still good and fast, I love using my iphone 11. Its a 85% iphone 11 pro at 65% of the price. So, in apple terms it is value for money.The good:- Fast processor! Same as iphone 11 pro/pro max- Awesome camera's (Again same as iphone 11pro and pro max except for the telephoto lens which can zoom 2x). Captures amazing low light pics. Ultra wide pics are good too! Best video camera ever in a phone.- Great battery backup. Lasts me a day. 1 hr gaming. A lot of browsing and chatting and some location tracking and still 15% at EOD.- iOS 13 is now mature and awesome to use. moved seamlessly from my iphone 8.The not so good:- Screen. Well its not an OLED! But still decent enough. Decent to look at. You wont feel its bad but its not great!- Front camera is average. Doesnt have a night mode. And the images are decent but not great again. Front wide angle is a joke.- 5W charger in box! Apple, I cannot hate you enough for this. You sell a 70k rs phone and give us a slow charger.What iphone 11 pro/pro max have but this doesnt?- OLED Screen (if you a fan of amazing to look at screens. I dont miss it)- Telephoto lens (Again I dont miss it ever! I mean how often would you require a 2x zoom? Its not like a 5x optical)- Metallic side body (In a cover you dont need a metallic body and I drop my phones so often that they are always protected in a cover)- Fast charger in box. I bought it online separately(HATE YOU APPLE FOR THIS)- Thats it!!!I cant see why most people would go for pro models! There is hardly any value addition and unless you have a lot of spare money, iphone 11 can everything what and iphone 11 pro/pro max can do!

", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "05 Dec 2019,"], ["            This is my first iPhone. After being an Android enthusiast and loyalist for over a decade, poor Pixel design and besting camera of iPhone 11 made me switch to the walled garden. Coming from Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge I had my doubts on the LCD screen and low resolution, but believe me my doubts were unfounded. The screen on iPhone 11 is crisp and clear, with good color accuracy and balanced punch. I did a lot research comparing iPhone 11, the pro and max models as well, along with Note 10 and OnePlus 7T Pro. Comparing them side by side, iPhone 11 always came out on top in camera department - the most important criteria for me (which had made me choose S7 years ago). I also looked at iPhone XR, but the 11 offers substantial updates over XR.-----------------------************------------------------Here are the pros from the last few days of usage:1) Excellent battery life - I consistently end my day at 40+ %. All while I am still exploring the phone (and hence using it more).2) Dual camera system - the normal iPhone 11 makes the perfect compromise from the pro models - retaining the same primary sensor and wide angle sensor - I can live without the telephoto. Essentially the same quality as the pro. Pictures are true to life, accurate in color and great HDR. Low light performance is again top notch.3) A13 bionic and butter smooth experience. Never experienced lag free ui before - even 12GB RAM model Note 10 stuttered when testing.4) Promise of timely updates, straight from Apple. No OEM BS. This is an underrated and misunderstood parameter. I am paying comparable money for Android phones and getting latest OS after 6+ months and that too for only 2 years (followed by 1 year of security updates). Apple's promise of 5 year updates is reassuring - with increasing use of financial transactions on mobile getting security releases and bug fixes on day of release is critical.5) Build quality and design are unparalleled. Love the design - grows on you. Apple is a premium brand and you can feel the attention to detail in alignment of ports, ui elements, the milled camera cutout, etc.6) Gestures - Android does a piss poor job of this. Samsung's dumb implementation on Note 10 killed it for me. I don't need a split pill for the sake of it and call it Gestures. iOS does it so much better and in an intuitive style. I wonder how I was using my phone in now what feels like an archaic way through back button (and pixel's implementation is pathetic and confusing).7) Face ID is way more convenient that fingerprint and security unmatched on Android. I don't need to fiddle any more with my fingers to unlock and then navigate the phone. Seems Face ID and Gesture navigation complement each other to make a powerful and smooth user experience. I can navigate the phone instantly so my hands dont need to first fiddle with a fingerprint scanner and then shift the hold and focus to navigation. It's these small things that makes Apple what it is - a pleasurable experience.------------------------***********-----------------------Cons:1) LCD - The phone's biggest weakness is the screen. Don't get me wrong its an excellent LCD, only marred by lack of true blacks. Even then I am using the dark mode coz I like it.2) Photos app froze once for me when trying to share a large number of live photos on Whatsapp. Had to restart the phone to solve the issue. Hope this was an one off error.3) 5W charger - at this price it's fair to expect a fast charger, given the phone is capable of fast charging.4) Few apps that were free on Android are paid on iOS. I was surprised to find this. Nonetheless I bought the app as it was critical for me (didn't want to lose years of data from Android).5) Default zoom and text size make it difficult to read the text. Increasing either makes the screen seem less sharp.6) 3rd party keyboard - cannot be used in some apps. Only the pre-installed Apple keyboard shows up (maybe some security reason). This leads to poor trying experience. E.g. in the Outlook app SwiftKey never shows up. Can't get my head around this, as this breaks an otherwise smooth experience.--------------------************----------------------Final words - go for iPhone if you can afford it. Comparable Android flagships are way behind as an experience and complete package.***************************************Love the black color.***************************************Fun fact - tempered glass and case ordered an hour the phone were delivered the next morning and the phone was delivered late in the evening after continued follow up with customer care.

For the detailed review read below :PROS1.) BATTERY LIFE IS GREAAAT. Coming from 6s it   s a huge upgrade. My phone lasts me a day and a half in case of normal use. A day in case I stream a lot of Netflix.2.) CAMERA. I haven   t been able to test it outside. I   ve just clicked a few pictures of people indoors and it feels like a huge upgrade from my 6s.

In fact, it is the same, except for the camera module which now is a square with two lenses, a flash and a microphone. The camera slot has a trademark iPhone look, even though it is the first time Apple has used it, because the shape is similar to that of the app icons on iOS.

With the iPhone 11, which is even more affordable than its predecessor, Apple must be hoping to go a step further in sales.But does the iPhone 11 have the fire power to become a runaway success across the world? After all, it is not just the price that matters to a lot of users.AdvertisingApple iPhone 11 price in India: Rs 64,900 for 64GB, Rs 69,900 for 128GB and 79,900 for 256GBApple iPhone 11 specifications: 6.1-inch LCD Liquid Retina HD display, 1792 x 828   pixel resolution at 326 ppi | A13 Bionic chipset | Dual 12MP Ultra Wide and Wide cameras with 2x optical zoom out; digital zoom up to 5x, Ultra Wide:   /2.4 aperture and 120   field of view, Wide:   /1.8 aperture | TrueDepth Camera (Front camera) 12MP camera with   /2.2 aperture | Battery: One hour longer than iPhone XR | IP68 rating for dust and water resistance |RELATED NEWSApple sets new Q4 records in India, Cook says    locally relevant prices    helpingYou might struggle to get your hands on iPhone 11 this Diwali: Here   s whyApple iPhone 11 launch has not impacted OnePlus 7T sales: CEO Pete Lauiphone 11, apple iphone 11, iphone 11 review, iphone 11 price in india, iphone 11 mobile review, apple iphone 11 mobile review, iphone 11 specs, iphone 11 specifications, iphone 11 price in india 2019The 6.1-inch LCD display too has been left untouched, though it now adds Dolby Vision and HDR 10.Apple iPhone 11 reviewThe iPhone 11 looks a lot like the iPhone XR. In fact, it is the same, except for the camera module which now is a square with two lenses, a flash and a microphone. The camera slot has a trademark iPhone look, even though it is the first time Apple has used it, because the shape is similar to that of the app icons on iOS. From the glass back to the aluminium frame, everything else stays the same, though you have a new Green and Lavender Purple colour to choose from now.AdvertisingThe 6.1-inch LCD display too has been left untouched, though it now adds Dolby Vision and HDR 10 making the viewing experience much more pleasurable. Also, the phone now has a IP68 rating, making it better at dust and water resistance. The iPhone 11 offers a good grip despite being a reasonable sized smartphone.iphone 11, apple iphone 11, iphone 11 review, iphone 11 price in india, iphone 11 mobile review, apple iphone 11 mobile review, iphone 11 specs, iphone 11 specifications, iphone 11 price in india 2019The camera slot has a trademark iPhone look, even though it is the first time Apple has used it, because the shape is similar to that of the app icons on iOS.The one feature that has all Apple fans excited is the dual camera on the iPhone 11. The phone has two 12MP cameras, one wide and the other ultra-wide. The wide-angle camera itself is not a new concept, but Apple   s take of a wide-angle camera is. In fact, the 120-degree field of view is packed into a 4:3 frame, which is unique and giving a whole new perspective. While if does not give the images a fish eye look, especially in landscapes, it ends up being a different way to showcase a landscape photo.The iPhone 11 is also a good handycam replacement because you can shoot 4K at 60FPS using both the lenses and this ability to switch to ultra-wide for video is seamless. I loved the fact that even with slow-motion, both the lenses come into play. The video experience on this phone is the smoothest I have seen so far and it also stays cool even after long 4K shoots.Apple iPhone 11 specifications: 6.1-inch LCD Liquid Retina HD display, 1792 x 828   pixel resolution at 326 ppi | A13 Bionic chipset | Dual 12MP Ultra Wide and Wide cameras with 2x optical zoom out; digital zoom up to 5x, Ultra Wide:   /2.4 aperture and 120   field of view, Wide:   /1.8 aperture | TrueDepth Camera (Front camera) 12MP camera with   /2.2 aperture | Battery: One hour longer than iPhone XR | IP68 rating for dust and water resistance |  ", "0 users found this review helpful", "4 stars", "16 Nov 2019,"], ["            Like  ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "15 Nov 2019,"], ["            In daily usage this phone is awesomeAnd love this phone  ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "15 Nov 2019,"], ["Perfect iphone after iphone x and xs           ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "15 Nov 2019,"], ["In daily usage this phone is awesomeAnd love this phone           ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "15 Nov 2019,"], ["            Awesome experience with Iphone 11  ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "15 Nov 2019,"], ["            Great phone ever apple has made  ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "15 Nov 2019,"], ["            Perfect iphone after iphone x and xs  ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "15 Nov 2019,"], ["Great phone ever apple has made           ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "15 Nov 2019,"], ["Awesome experience with Iphone 11           ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "15 Nov 2019,"], ["Like           ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "15 Nov 2019,"], ["In a simple word, the product is awesome               ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "14 Nov 2019,"], ["Super built quality           ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "14 Nov 2019,"], ["Gloss look.

So please read.When you are on shopping for a premium phone, you should look for a few important things, especially spending so much money on a device.1. The brand value. Ultimately you should be proud to take your phone out in between a crowd2. Super features. especially the camera3. Beautiful looks.All of the above are satisfied with this phone. And there is no reason one should not buy this phone. Not convinced? Read on my full review.=== Camera ===I used Samsung S series since S2 and switched to Note series since Note 5 till Note 9. So this time I switched the brand and I don't regret. Compare to my Note 9 cameras, iPhone 11 cameras are far superior in terms of taking selfies or regular photos. Just point your subject and instantly focuses on the subject and the background will be blurred like the pro-grade camera. My friends don't believe that the photos taken are on a phone and not DSLR. That itself says all.=== Screen ===Not a super sensitive screen like the super awesome AMOLED one on my Note 9, but it doesn't fall behind as well. The screen is super responsive and shows the colors accurately. However, it feels smaller compared to my Note 9 screen or even iPhone 11 Pro. I don't say this screen is the ultimate screen but is very good at this price point. If you want an ultimate screen, go for the iPhone 11 Pro which has OLED screen.=== Software ===This is the pain point. After using Android for so many years, you will feel very inconvenient with iOS. But once you started using it, you will find it easy. Just a word of caution: If you are using Whatsapp, you will lose all your existing chats and data. There is no way to migrate your data from Android to iPhone. The only possible way is buying third party software which costs $20 dollars and that too does not work 100% correct. So be prepared to lose your WhatsApp data before migration.=== App Ecosystem ===Nothing to complain here. Everything available on Android is also there on iOS and to be frank more than Android. So this is one of the plus points. But the minus point is - all iOS developers want to milk money out of users. Some apps/games which are free on Android are paid on iOS.=== Services ===If you are an avid user of Google services, you find something missing or uncomfortable in using their services. Android so much integrated with Google services such as GMail, Drive, Maps, Photos and so on; you will find all of them on iOS but are no so much integrated.  My suggestion is to switch to Apple services wherever possible.=== Battery ===The battery lasts the whole day and is one of the best. However, the charger that comes with the phone is a low end charger. It won't have a quick charging facility. So I started using my Note 9 charger which works better.So that's all about my journey so far with the amazing iPhone 11.

There is no way to migrate your data from Android to iPhone. The only possible way is buying third party software which costs $20 dollars and that too does not work 100% correct. So be prepared to lose your WhatsApp data before migration.=== App Ecosystem ===Nothing to complain here. Everything available on Android is also there on iOS and to be frank more than Android. So this is one of the plus points. But the minus point is - all iOS developers want to milk money out of users. Some apps/games which are free on Android are paid on iOS.=== Services ===If you are an avid user of Google services, you find something missing or uncomfortable in using their services. Android so much integrated with Google services such as GMail, Drive, Maps, Photos and so on; you will find all of them on iOS but are no so much integrated.  My suggestion is to switch to Apple services wherever possible.=== Battery ===The battery lasts the whole day and is one of the best. However, the charger that comes with the phone is a low end charger. It won't have a quick charging facility. So I started using my Note 9 charger which works better.So that's all about my journey so far with the amazing iPhone 11.

No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags!Now, off to the device.ProsThe device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal.Speakers sound better than my previous phone.A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe!OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work.Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either.ConsRemember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced.Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them.No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones.Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny.

I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags!Now, off to the device.ProsThe device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal.Speakers sound better than my previous phone.A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe!OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work.Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either.ConsRemember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced.Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them.No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones.Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.
