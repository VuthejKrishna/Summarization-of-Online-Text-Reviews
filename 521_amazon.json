Even camera in night mode gets real average.I have been facing issue with screen display. I tried to fix it using some feedbacks but It just didn't work out.I haven't tried hardcore gaming.Most importantly:- Phone will go unnoticed everywhere cause of it's typical design unlike an iPhone.Invest in iphone if you are really ready for 70k.

Note10 Plus exceeeeeeeeeeeeds all my requirements. I feel the power in my hands. And I believe it won't diminish in next 10 years from now. Some additions to my expectations:1. With S-Pen, I am able to take side notes when on any call, convert it into Word or PDF doc email it immediately.2. The charging tests on you tube show that it takes 66 mins to fully charge with 25W charger. Somehow, with me it took only 56 mins for full charging.3. The speakers will blow your head clean off.....They are so amazingly louuuuud.4. I game on my PC and hate mobile for that stuff. With Note10PLUS, I left PC for sometime and started gaming on mobile.If you are a person, who attend remote meetings with Webex, need to share notes and docs quickly, do gaming, watch movies ...

I love the way it looks and feels in hand. Its design is just beautiful. Over all it is a BIG phone but you wont feel it while using, its very convenient to use.2. Display is the best I've known so far! The display will SPOIL you, just cant get enough of it.3. Battery stands brilliant, over a day.4. I wasn't expecting the phone to have such fast charging capability. 30-40 mins of charge per day, you are good to go. Take s about an hour to full charge, that's it!!!5. S Pen: Handwriting to text. I love the way it can convert my handwriting to text! Something I did not think would be so useful, but you can end up exporting the Samsung notes to Word documents. Brilliant!6. Air Actions are something I would use only for selfies. Its very convenient. Haven't  tried more air actions as I never needed them.7. Samsung's ONE UI is a LOT better than the one we used to see on Samsung devices. No more SAMSUNG LAG! The phone is very snappy. P.S: I come from OnePlus which was Snappy but not as fast as this one.8.  Gaming, heavy usage anything, this phone handles it very well.9. You get a phone case, headphones in the box unlike any other manufacturer these days.10. Insanely stable videos, and the editing mode. Just a boon I say!Cons:1. Finger print scanner could have been better.2. Facial recolonization is a joke. Phone will unlock with my eyes closed. Like seriously Samsung? Anyone can unlock my phone while I am asleep.3. Lack of headphone jack is a pain but the fact they provide decent pair of headphones in the box covers it up.4. Camera is not what you expect from a Flagship company like Samsung on a Flagship device. The shutter speed is low and that means you cant have snappy pictures. Having said that, the phone takes decent pictures. I just hope they increase the shutter speed in future updates.Overall experience:This is the best NOTE Samsung have made so far, its a complete package. If you have a budget of 80k (74k if you can avail cashback from ICICI and HDFC) for a phone, this is the best phone you can get. Not to forget its cheaper than the Iphone. I love the fact that Samsung launches the products on same price as in US when compared to Apple which sells at a premium of 20-30k min. Samsung gives you the best for the buck.I would rate it 5 stars.Hope my review helps! :)           ", "9 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "10 Sep 2019,"], ["Damaged product received and I had bought same for my mom for her birthday .I am very disappointed           ", "8 users found this review helpful", "1 stars", "27 Aug 2019,"], ["Simply the best.

The wide angle, zoom and extra wide lenses on the back are very useful in all situations. Night mode is a great addition as it increases brightness and dynamic range in low light shots all the while keeping down the noise.6. The s-pen has good functionality. Can use it for quickly jotting down your to-do list.7. Battery life has been very very good. I am a heavy user and I can tell you it will definitely last you the whole day!!! Fast charging is super fast at just over an hour to the full charge.8. Speakers are very loud and very clear even at high volumes. The stereo effect is well balanced and very pleasant.

I have never used a Samsung smartphone before. But now, I have become a big fan. Thumbs up to Samsung!Pros:1. Mesmerizing design, something Chinese flagships can't match!2. 12 GB ram is very very useful...I haven't yet found an app that had to be restarted. A boon for multitaskers.3. Starting at 256gb of memory makes you worry less about running out of space and pay less for cloud services!4. Gaming performance is just brilliant! I have played heavy games like PUBG and Fortnite and yet to find a lag.5. The camera quality is DSLR like. The front camera is truly amazing! The wide angle, zoom and extra wide lenses on the back are very useful in all situations. Night mode is a great addition as it increases brightness and dynamic range in low light shots all the while keeping down the noise.6. The s-pen has good functionality. Can use it for quickly jotting down your to-do list.7. Battery life has been very very good. I am a heavy user and I can tell you it will definitely last you the whole day!!! Fast charging is super fast at just over an hour to the full charge.8. Speakers are very loud and very clear even at high volumes. The stereo effect is well balanced and very pleasant. The AKG headset provided with the smartphone is of good quality and has punchy bass with balanced mids and trebles.9. Finally the display! The crown jewel of the smartphone! Colour reproduction is on the point, contrast is just perfect and very high peak brightness gives great outdoor visibility. Superb for playing games and streaming. Just watch an HDR movie on it and thank me later;) Definitely the best display I have ever seen!Cons:Lacks a headphone jack but USB c headphones are provided.Conclusion: Buy it and you won't regret.

Thanks Amazon!!Ok, coming to the device, it is a beast to put it in simple terms.1. Display is the best one can get as of now on a mobile. No other phone can come closer. Coming from Note 8, I find the relatively flattened edges more comfortable. Display quality, brightness, sunlight legibility everything is top notch. Just don't go into that 90hz display stuff. Not sure if that matters for a hard core gamer if at all, but it simply means nothing for most. The QHD display on N10+ is the best.2. Stereo speaker output is simply awesome. Samsung managed to pull out full bodied sound output from this tiny setup. Generally mobile stereo setups sound anaemic and lack the lower end of the sound spectrum. That's not the case with this device. Perfectly enjoyable.3. Cameras on the rear are the same as on S10+ and that's not a bad thing. They are quite capable and optically stabilized, with considerably larger pixel size. Software optimization may be required in certain cases to control over exposure and better dynamic range. Hope Samsung will fix these issues via an update. These are minor software glitches. Selfie camera too is very good. Minor gripe here would be the availability of gcam mod, esp for the variant sold in India i.e. with Exynos chip. Samsung night mode is quite good though.4. Battery. Now, this is one of the important reasons I wanted to post this review. On paper the battery is bumped up to 4300mah. Screen size also increased to 6.8 inches. But the latest iteration of Exynos chip - 9825 is built on 7nm process which is more power efficient than it's last year sibling. All these factors combined I was expecting a very good battery life. However that wasn't to be initially. There was way too much of battery drain and I was worried if I would be able to squeeze at least 5 hours of screen on time on this device. The issue was not with screen consuming the power but with battery drain. On checking the battery usage one app with name phone services was draining the battery. It took some time for me to understand that the app is about the sim toolkit apps Airtel Live and Jio 4G. Went into app manager and killed them both. Airtel doesn't restart itself but Jio does. The other thing I did was to allow the battery to die completely and then recharge it to 100%. In fact Apple recommends to do this once a month to elongate battery life. After doing these two things, battery life improved drastically. As I am writing this review on my N10+ it is at 74% after 6 hours of disconnecting from charge and screen usage of 3 hour 5 mins. Extrapolating would mean a SOT of about 12 hours. Consdering varied usage scenarios at least 9 SOT hours is assured.5. Audio. Well, I honestly didn't like the approach of Samsung in this regard. They have removed the 3.5mm Jack which made them join the club of mindless manufacturers. Not having space to accommodate one on this mammoth is a stupid reason which no one would believe. Esp when Samsung acquired Harman and launched an array of bluetooth headphones and buds. They didn't even include an adapter in the box. It is not available for purchase yet in India. Priced at $14.99 in the US, it is available only in late October there as well. It is simply tricking customers into buying the BT headphones. But for the money we pay the audio quality would be simply crap on those BTs. For someone who had invested into expensive wired audio gear, simply denying it's usability in the name of technological advancement. And N10+ needs an active dongle, i.e. a dongle with dac built in. So the passive dongles like the OnePlus 3.5mm adapter wont work with this. Tweeted Samsung India about the dongle availability but they preferred silence. Audio quality via galaxy buds is decent enough but that's not any basis to conclude the audio quality as the buds support only AAC and Samsung's proprietary scalable codec. No aptx or aptx HD there. Going by gsmarena, audio quality via dongle is very good. So for now it is second hand info.But for these minor gripes it is undoubtedly the best android flagship device right now. For those who use s-pen there is no such other device elsewhere in the android ecosystem. It is such a great productivity tool and hand writing recognition is lethal addition to the already powerful s-pen utilities. It works quite well too.Overall a powerful and feature rich device well made by Samsung. Hope this helps you guys in deciding on this device.Cheers!

I had forgotten about all the little things I used to enjoy about android. The multitasking on this phone cannot be compared to any other phone. simple things like jotting down a phone number while on a call is easier on this phone. If you want such things in your phone that is the things which make a phone a phone go for this one.Definetly the iphone gets points for the software but only that. The latest iphone costs 1.09 lakh for the 64gb base model it's a joke. The iPhone's work well in a iphone environment you need to have a macbook iPad to get full productivity off an iphone. Now about the screen of this phone is off the charts seriously best screen available on any phone in the market right now.  The battery gets me a full days work every day without a doubt and the fast charging helps me get a 100 percent in one hour each and every time.Now people compare this phone with the one plus devices but that is a different phone for a different population and the reviews by the western reviewers are always good because they are sent a better device to review the indian market gets a worse device by default but samsung has invested a lot in india to improve its quality and provide devices that are on par with the western counterparts.Hope this was helpful for the person who is going to buy a new mobile phone this season.

I love the way it looks and feels in hand. Its design is just beautiful. Over all it is a BIG phone but you wont feel it while using, its very convenient to use.2. Display is the best I've known so far! The display will SPOIL you, just cant get enough of it.3. Battery stands brilliant, over a day.4. I wasn't expecting the phone to have such fast charging capability. 30-40 mins of charge per day, you are good to go. Take s about an hour to full charge, that's it!!!5. S Pen: Handwriting to text. I love the way it can convert my handwriting to text! Something I did not think would be so useful, but you can end up exporting the Samsung notes to Word documents. Brilliant!6. Air Actions are something I would use only for selfies. Its very convenient. Haven't  tried more air actions as I never needed them.7. Samsung's ONE UI is a LOT better than the one we used to see on Samsung devices. No more SAMSUNG LAG! The phone is very snappy. P.S: I come from OnePlus which was Snappy but not as fast as this one.8.  Gaming, heavy usage anything, this phone handles it very well.9. You get a phone case, headphones in the box unlike any other manufacturer these days.10. Insanely stable videos, and the editing mode. Just a boon I say!Cons:1. Finger print scanner could have been better.2. Facial recolonization is a joke. Phone will unlock with my eyes closed. Like seriously Samsung? Anyone can unlock my phone while I am asleep.3. Lack of headphone jack is a pain but the fact they provide decent pair of headphones in the box covers it up.4. Camera is not what you expect from a Flagship company like Samsung on a Flagship device. The shutter speed is low and that means you cant have snappy pictures. Having said that, the phone takes decent pictures. I just hope they increase the shutter speed in future updates.Overall experience:This is the best NOTE Samsung have made so far, its a complete package. If you have a budget of 80k (74k if you can avail cashback from ICICI and HDFC) for a phone, this is the best phone you can get. Not to forget its cheaper than the Iphone. I love the fact that Samsung launches the products on same price as in US when compared to Apple which sells at a premium of 20-30k min. Samsung gives you the best for the buck.I would rate it 5 stars.Hope my review helps! :)           ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "10 Sep 2019,"], ["I was waiting to get this phone on my hand to play  I have always been Samsung galaxy fan  best design  and great feature  I have used from note to note 10  all series  they have been great and improved everytime with new deviceThis is the perfect device to buy  great camera quality.

I play PUBG n COD 2-3 hours everyday. I charge once a day.3) 90Hz speed is definitely noticeable while surfing or using apps4) 855+ chipset with Adreno 640 is currently the best available combination for high end mobiles.5) I did benchmarking for my phone to know it's peak performance, how much max temp it will reach, max FPS etc I'll attach the photo here6) Can play any games available at play store at Max graphics but this will heatup the phone.Cons1) They should definitely work on camera. When I click photo's with my phone it gives decent ones but not upto the mark compared to Note 10+ or Pixel.2) Phone do get heatup while playing games. Sometimes due to its glass back i can feel it's getting really hot. It will reach around 47 degrees3) You cannot rely on the case which OnePlus provides. You need to buy military grade protection case. If you drop it from more than 4 feet, it's glass back or screen will be shattered. You can watch it on YouTube4) Cheap trick from OnePlus is that they have removed headphone jack and anyone who want to use wired headphones, need to buy connector from their website it will cost 390 + 49 delivery fee.Did notice screen flickering while charging but it went away on it's own.This is my view on the phone                  ", "248 users found this review helpful", "4 stars", "17 Oct 2019,"], ["Best           ", "96 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "17 Oct 2019,"], ["Its fastest phone that I have ever experienced.

It's worth the read if you plan on purchasing this device. ====I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below.OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro.===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ====+ Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus.+ Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance.+ Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T.+ Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology.+ Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro)+ Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well.==== What's in the Box? ====OnePlus 7T Pro Device.User Manual.Transparent Silicon Case.SIM Ejector Tool.Warp 30T Charging Brick.Type C USB Cable.And some cool OnePlus Stickers.==== Display ====Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this.==== Performance ====Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined. 855 Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. Haven't experienced any drops in frames. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday.==== Camera ====I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. The Wide Angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges. Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too.==== Video ====If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro.==== Software ====This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android.==== Battery ====Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage.==== What could've been improved ====- Minor improvements on Camera.- No ToF sensor- No Wireless Charging.- IP Rating.- Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades.==== Verdict ====No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box.If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck.If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.

My experience so far with this:1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays.2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. For a normal user, it's just perfect.3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom.4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast.5.

Just understand guys OP can give us bigger 5K -6K Battery  but not making such big battery phone ,reson behind this was that More Big Battery really take much more time than what we expected from OP.Also 4085 MAH is sufficient ,really good for Daily need .2 Days battery life are just bluff even 6K MAH battery ROG is not giving 2 Days battery backup.2:Display : Great ! The highlighted point what i fall upon on OP7T Pro is its Display .tooooo Saxy and amaze to experience.3:Fast Charging : I think this is the reply if any one asking for big battery.I am Travelling centric person ,suppose i visited any of my clients/Place for 30 Min in a day so i can get my phone charged for 60-70% immediately that no phonce can perform like that.So understand All new Develop 30T Wrap Charger is biggest Pro of OP 7T Pro. Tooooo fast.4:No Notch : Even in Latest Iphone having ugly notch believ me phone not having notch looking more beautiful that any notch phone.Especially when you watching videos or Doing any excel work.5: Ultra fast Oxigen OS: feel i using Stock android experience.So no Discussion for this.6:855+ Snap Dragon : Don't be hype but it's is similer A13 Chip.Only in few matter A13 won like vedio randering etc which 99% People don't needed.7: good network Reception :Yes ,I was blindly believe that Samsung Mobile having (S10+) best network Reception in industry but first time OP performance is really amazing.8:Voice Quality:Similer to iphone so no complain.9Vibration Motor: I still give 1st Rank to Apple devices  because vibration lavel of any iphone is best in industry but this time OP did somthing amazing with their devices OP 7T pro having different motor which is 90%Similer to Iphone.10:Camera : frankly says here i feel compromise because earlier i was having XS max iphone which was far ahead than this device ,yes micro mode is something exiting for me.CON :1: Big Phone :So before making any decisions just understand this is a BIG phone2: Sleepery Design : if you are a person that using phone while driving (2 Wheelers), putting in halmet while biking so this will not fullfill your requirements because of it Saxy design. This is the phone where in office meeting you can put on table afore all employees and showoff.3: Nothing More just one request /Suggestions to OP that stay on your previous policy to launch single device in a year.My few friends bought OP 7 pro just 3 month Ago and now OP launches these 2 phones 7T and 7T pro.Now Maclaren.....So OP we indian belief on brands so don't changes policy that customer felt they cheated.So Guys this is my all details on this device and my prior devises.hope you all enjoyed to take this before going to expens your bucks.

Plus you get full screen with 90hrz refresh rate which is simply awesome n you do feel difference.Pop up camera is good but over time i beleive it might be difficult to maintain as there is a possibility of dust particles entering it n you might end up cleaning lens before click.Cameras in general are pretty good and would have been best if Samsung S10 (also Apple) wouldn't be there. But at this price cameras are good.Warp charger in the box is amazing and charges superfast. But i woild like to mention about battery that it is ok not that it will last too long. I was expecting a good battery life which i got when there were no apps installed initially. Eventually when I loaded the phone fully I noticed the difference, earlier it was around 37% in 20 hour later 20%in 20 hours, considering heavy use, pretty decent still.Best part is OnePlus strives to improve so the above cons like battery life, camera I believe the company will keep providing updates to improve and they keep upgrading your OS quite fast, faster than other companies.

I am using this phone since a month now. I have used OnePlus 3T and OnePlus 6T prior to this one and can really feel the difference. OnePlus has really up their game this year with OnePlus 7 pro and then launched OnePlus 7T Pro with really minor updates.For a guy coming from EMUI of Huawei and Honor, the Oxygen OS does not provide much options which were available on EMUI device. I miss few features of it. But the Oxygen OS is still feature rich and provides you a lot of customizations. Curved display is amazing and speakers are loud for media consumption. Never thought I would enjoy using any OnePlus device this much. I am using the phone daily on 90hz screen refresh rate and QHD+ resolution so getting the screen on time of 5.5 to 6 hours on a single charge.The fingerprint scanner is blazing fast and so is the face unlock. Granted the face unlock is a bit slow compared to the phones having front camera under the notch but its still worth it. The pop-up selfie camera is also good but now I think OnePlus should really improve the sensor as its been the same since OnePlus 3.Rear camera's are really good. I loved how the Nightscape works. It even takes satisfied shots in dim lit conditions.This phone is gamer's delight. You can play games like PUBG, COD without any lag at highest settings.Warp Charge is insanely fast. I am coming from Huawei's 22.5w super charging which used to charge my phone to 57% in 30 mins. Warp Charge 30T charges my OnePlus 7T Pro to 77% in 30 mins. Amazing!I am a really heavy user so I faced some of the below issues and hope OnePlus would fix them in future phones:- Phone's pricing is a bit premium. They could have kept the pricing to around 45K INR and could have also given 128gb/6gb version in around 42K INR- Front camera should have auto focus and I think it requires upgrade in terms of the sensor- OnePlus should try to fit LED notification somewhere as the ambient display doesn't help much. They can also provide Always-On-Display functionality- I sorely miss the 3.5mm headphone jack. Sure we can use wired headphones with a converter but I got the converter in box for OnePlus 6T and not in this one? What a cheap move by OnePlus- Even though you have Warp Charge 30T, the phone does not support even Qualcomm quick charge 3.0 like Realme X2 pro so it charges at 5V/2amp rate with the other chargers. That is really disappointing  ", "0 users found this review helpful", "4 stars", "15 Oct 2019,"], ["Best product of one plus so far!!! It has 90hz refresh rate but you can use 60hz until it's required to be speeded up. Battery is good and Warp charger is awesome, screen is completely mind blowing. Front and back cameras speaks alot as  trade Mark OnePlus shots but slow motion capture is bit disappointing. Rather than spending on iPhone 11pro Max you can have OnePlus 7t pro especially McLaren edition I just Love it to the core. So stylish and attractive model, a perfect premium phone.

Same as iphone 11 pro/pro max- Awesome camera's (Again same as iphone 11pro and pro max except for the telephoto lens which can zoom 2x). Captures amazing low light pics. Ultra wide pics are good too! Best video camera ever in a phone.- Great battery backup. Lasts me a day. 1 hr gaming. A lot of browsing and chatting and some location tracking and still 15% at EOD.- iOS 13 is now mature and awesome to use. moved seamlessly from my iphone 8.The not so good:- Screen. Well its not an OLED! But still decent enough. Decent to look at. You wont feel its bad but its not great!- Front camera is average. Doesnt have a night mode. And the images are decent but not great again. Front wide angle is a joke.- 5W charger in box! Apple, I cannot hate you enough for this. You sell a 70k rs phone and give us a slow charger.What iphone 11 pro/pro max have but this doesnt?- OLED Screen (if you a fan of amazing to look at screens. I dont miss it)- Telephoto lens (Again I dont miss it ever! I mean how often would you require a 2x zoom? Its not like a 5x optical)- Metallic side body (In a cover you dont need a metallic body and I drop my phones so often that they are always protected in a cover)- Fast charger in box. I bought it online separately(HATE YOU APPLE FOR THIS)- Thats it!!!I cant see why most people would go for pro models!

After being an Android enthusiast and loyalist for over a decade, poor Pixel design and besting camera of iPhone 11 made me switch to the walled garden. Coming from Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge I had my doubts on the LCD screen and low resolution, but believe me my doubts were unfounded. The screen on iPhone 11 is crisp and clear, with good color accuracy and balanced punch. I did a lot research comparing iPhone 11, the pro and max models as well, along with Note 10 and OnePlus 7T Pro. Comparing them side by side, iPhone 11 always came out on top in camera department - the most important criteria for me (which had made me choose S7 years ago). I also looked at iPhone XR, but the 11 offers substantial updates over XR.-----------------------************------------------------Here are the pros from the last few days of usage:1) Excellent battery life - I consistently end my day at 40+ %. All while I am still exploring the phone (and hence using it more).2) Dual camera system - the normal iPhone 11 makes the perfect compromise from the pro models - retaining the same primary sensor and wide angle sensor - I can live without the telephoto. Essentially the same quality as the pro. Pictures are true to life, accurate in color and great HDR. Low light performance is again top notch.3) A13 bionic and butter smooth experience. Never experienced lag free ui before - even 12GB RAM model Note 10 stuttered when testing.4) Promise of timely updates, straight from Apple. No OEM BS. This is an underrated and misunderstood parameter. I am paying comparable money for Android phones and getting latest OS after 6+ months and that too for only 2 years (followed by 1 year of security updates). Apple's promise of 5 year updates is reassuring - with increasing use of financial transactions on mobile getting security releases and bug fixes on day of release is critical.5) Build quality and design are unparalleled. Love the design - grows on you. Apple is a premium brand and you can feel the attention to detail in alignment of ports, ui elements, the milled camera cutout, etc.6) Gestures - Android does a piss poor job of this. Samsung's dumb implementation on Note 10 killed it for me. I don't need a split pill for the sake of it and call it Gestures. iOS does it so much better and in an intuitive style. I wonder how I was using my phone in now what feels like an archaic way through back button (and pixel's implementation is pathetic and confusing).7) Face ID is way more convenient that fingerprint and security unmatched on Android. I don't need to fiddle any more with my fingers to unlock and then navigate the phone. Seems Face ID and Gesture navigation complement each other to make a powerful and smooth user experience. I can navigate the phone instantly so my hands dont need to first fiddle with a fingerprint scanner and then shift the hold and focus to navigation. It's these small things that makes Apple what it is - a pleasurable experience.------------------------***********-----------------------Cons:1) LCD - The phone's biggest weakness is the screen. Don't get me wrong its an excellent LCD, only marred by lack of true blacks. Even then I am using the dark mode coz I like it.2) Photos app froze once for me when trying to share a large number of live photos on Whatsapp. Had to restart the phone to solve the issue. Hope this was an one off error.3) 5W charger - at this price it's fair to expect a fast charger, given the phone is capable of fast charging.4) Few apps that were free on Android are paid on iOS. I was surprised to find this. Nonetheless I bought the app as it was critical for me (didn't want to lose years of data from Android).5) Default zoom and text size make it difficult to read the text. Increasing either makes the screen seem less sharp.6) 3rd party keyboard - cannot be used in some apps. Only the pre-installed Apple keyboard shows up (maybe some security reason). This leads to poor trying experience. E.g. in the Outlook app SwiftKey never shows up. Can't get my head around this, as this breaks an otherwise smooth experience.--------------------************----------------------Final words - go for iPhone if you can afford it. Comparable Android flagships are way behind as an experience and complete package.***************************************Love the black color.***************************************Fun fact - tempered glass and case ordered an hour the phone were delivered the next morning and the phone was delivered late in the evening after continued follow up with customer care.

I bought this in purple and it   s really beautiful.CONS (Might vary from person to person. I wasn   t really bothered by this)1.) CHARGING TIME TOO MUCH. It takes a while to charge with the stock charger. You need a fast charger for actual fast charging. It would be good if you invest in one.2.) DISPLAY.

It has thicker bezels than the iPhone X, XS and 11 pro models. It would bother anyone who   s coming from a phone with thinner bezels. My suggestion is don   t upgrade to this in case you have a X. Wait till next year.4.) NOTCH. Again, this depends on your preference. It   s not that bothering though.iPhone 11 is a great phone for that price tag. I   ve been using iPhones since 3GS.

The phone has two 12MP cameras, one wide and the other ultra-wide. The wide-angle camera itself is not a new concept, but Apple   s take of a wide-angle camera is. In fact, the 120-degree field of view is packed into a 4:3 frame, which is unique and giving a whole new perspective. While if does not give the images a fish eye look, especially in landscapes, it ends up being a different way to showcase a landscape photo.The iPhone 11 is also a good handycam replacement because you can shoot 4K at 60FPS using both the lenses and this ability to switch to ultra-wide for video is seamless. I loved the fact that even with slow-motion, both the lenses come into play. The video experience on this phone is the smoothest I have seen so far and it also stays cool even after long 4K shoots.Apple iPhone 11 specifications: 6.1-inch LCD Liquid Retina HD display, 1792 x 828   pixel resolution at 326 ppi | A13 Bionic chipset | Dual 12MP Ultra Wide and Wide cameras with 2x optical zoom out; digital zoom up to 5x, Ultra Wide:   /2.4 aperture and 120   field of view, Wide:   /1.8 aperture | TrueDepth Camera (Front camera) 12MP camera with   /2.2 aperture | Battery: One hour longer than iPhone XR | IP68 rating for dust and water resistance |  ", "0 users found this review helpful", "4 stars", "16 Nov 2019,"], ["            Like  ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "15 Nov 2019,"], ["            In daily usage this phone is awesomeAnd love this phone  ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "15 Nov 2019,"], ["In daily usage this phone is awesomeAnd love this phone           ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "15 Nov 2019,"], ["Perfect iphone after iphone x and xs           ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "15 Nov 2019,"], ["            Awesome experience with Iphone 11  ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "15 Nov 2019,"], ["            Perfect iphone after iphone x and xs  ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "15 Nov 2019,"], ["            Great phone ever apple has made  ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "15 Nov 2019,"], ["Great phone ever apple has made           ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "15 Nov 2019,"], ["Awesome experience with Iphone 11           ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "15 Nov 2019,"], ["Like           ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "15 Nov 2019,"], ["In a simple word, the product is awesome               ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "14 Nov 2019,"], ["Super built quality           ", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "14 Nov 2019,"], ["Gloss look.

So please read.When you are on shopping for a premium phone, you should look for a few important things, especially spending so much money on a device.1. The brand value. Ultimately you should be proud to take your phone out in between a crowd2. Super features. especially the camera3. Beautiful looks.All of the above are satisfied with this phone. And there is no reason one should not buy this phone. Not convinced? Read on my full review.=== Camera ===I used Samsung S series since S2 and switched to Note series since Note 5 till Note 9. So this time I switched the brand and I don't regret. Compare to my Note 9 cameras, iPhone 11 cameras are far superior in terms of taking selfies or regular photos. Just point your subject and instantly focuses on the subject and the background will be blurred like the pro-grade camera. My friends don't believe that the photos taken are on a phone and not DSLR. That itself says all.=== Screen ===Not a super sensitive screen like the super awesome AMOLED one on my Note 9, but it doesn't fall behind as well. The screen is super responsive and shows the colors accurately. However, it feels smaller compared to my Note 9 screen or even iPhone 11 Pro. I don't say this screen is the ultimate screen but is very good at this price point. If you want an ultimate screen, go for the iPhone 11 Pro which has OLED screen.=== Software ===This is the pain point. After using Android for so many years, you will feel very inconvenient with iOS. But once you started using it, you will find it easy. Just a word of caution: If you are using Whatsapp, you will lose all your existing chats and data. There is no way to migrate your data from Android to iPhone. The only possible way is buying third party software which costs $20 dollars and that too does not work 100% correct. So be prepared to lose your WhatsApp data before migration.=== App Ecosystem ===Nothing to complain here. Everything available on Android is also there on iOS and to be frank more than Android. So this is one of the plus points. But the minus point is - all iOS developers want to milk money out of users. Some apps/games which are free on Android are paid on iOS.=== Services ===If you are an avid user of Google services, you find something missing or uncomfortable in using their services. Android so much integrated with Google services such as GMail, Drive, Maps, Photos and so on; you will find all of them on iOS but are no so much integrated.  My suggestion is to switch to Apple services wherever possible.=== Battery ===The battery lasts the whole day and is one of the best. However, the charger that comes with the phone is a low end charger. It won't have a quick charging facility. So I started using my Note 9 charger which works better.So that's all about my journey so far with the amazing iPhone 11.

However a clear rubberized backcover is provided in the box which fits perfectly with the phone body and provides required grip. Sceen is little bit wider and difficulties may arise for single hand use.Specs: The medium range hardware combination doing jobs smoothly with no major lags. High resolution processor hungry games or third party benchmark softwares were not tested.Software and User Interface: The designers almost neglected this vital issue, it does not have a customized OS or anything like that except the bare Android 9 OS and some useless free google apps. The designers must release updates to address the issue unless it will remain like a peacock without colourful feathers.Battery: The battery served a whole day of normal use, including exploration of features, installation of required apps etc. The battery management may not be as good as similar priced models of Realme or Asus, still about 30% charge remained at the end of the day. Charging is really fast.Sound and Video Quality: Sound of external speaker is really loud but the quality is missing somehow.Camera and photography: This was probably the most advertised part, prior to release. Daylight photography is ok but low light and indoor photos show little grains. AI beutification etc. are not as good as similar priced models of other brands with high resolution front camera.Signal reception and call quality is good. Provision for copying data like contacts etc. from old handset is there. Overall a medium-range decent handset without much complication for daily use.

After this Jio VoLTE is working fine.I have seen a lot of users complaining about heating up of the device. It might be an issue with your device and you might want to show it to a service centre.During the intial bootup and update of all the apps - my phone did not heat up. I have seen each and every phone to heat up when there are more than 5 or 6 updates from Play store.So, in case you are not getting VoLTE / phone heating up unnecessarily - may be it is time you take it to a service centre.Camerea software is a bit buggy. Sometimes it wont switch the camera from front to back and vice versa. Happened 2 or 3 times. But then, camera has never been a forte of BB.Onboard speakers are quite loud and crisp during handsfree calls or music.It is sad that it probably wont be getting any updates as Optiemus and BB are on legal tussle about royalty. So keep that in mind if OS update/ OS security patches.Overall :1. I am happy with it at 13K price point.2. I have never understood why people compare Oppo / Vivo/ Mi with phones like BB, Samsung or LG.. If you need better specced phones with no privacy / security assurance - please stay with Chinese phones. You can get much better specced phones at a much lower price. Because they can sell off your data to make up for the loss. 3. Camera is average. Not expected anything spectacular in the first place from BB in this department, so technically I cant say I am disappointed.4. BB Hub and Hub widget is awesome. But thanks to Google's new policies, it is now a bit messed up. But still very convenient.5. Fast charging works for me. You need to select it when connecting the phone to a charger.6. Fingerprint sensor is not very good. I would say below average - if you put your finger in a non standard orientation - it does not always detect. Face unlock works fine and is very fast.7. Call quality is crisp and clear.8. Double tap to wake / sleep is a handy option (borrowed from LG).9. Textured back is a very good choice as you wont be scared of the phone slipping out of your hand when using it.10. Screen is clear enough for normal use (FHD) but I may be spoiled by the UHD screen of my G6. So I think it will be fine for most users. It is IPS though and not AMOLED. But it is a fingerprint magnet. Would have liked some sort of coating from Optiemus to prevent that.11. No software updates (probably) in the future is pretty bad. I have should have personally done some research before buying this device. This is the real concern for me. Would have loved to see Pie on it.However - it seems really strange that people are speaking about poor gaming on this device.

I am never a fan of writing reviews. But I read few reviews and decided to write one.First, please understand that BlackBerry is an instrument that is secure and in earlier days it was used by professionals who needed secure transmission of emails and data. Second, this is not a camera, it's a mobile phone.That being said, this phone works really well. I have the regular apps like: WhatsApp, Instagram, Snapchat, PrimeVideo, Amazon Shopping, Hotstar, G Suite and their apps, few games, Axis Bank, iMobile, AmEx, SBI, HDFC, IRCTC, Swizzy, Zomato, and few more.I never had issues with phone being hanged.Battery usage is good. This depends on user to user. I use it for my work and personal purposes, and the battery never died up on me yet.Camera is good. If the purpose is to click a pic, and get a really good image, then this phone's camera specs are really good. If anyone is looking for a mobile phone who is looking for a professional photographer / studio quality pictures, then this is not your phone. You may buy an actual camera instead with all kinds of lens and all.All other features are good.Anyone heard about a BlackBerry phone being hacked?  I guess not.So if you need a phone for both official and personal purposes, then this phone is good for you.Hope this review helps in your buying decision.

Even though the Chinese brands have better specs in paper, in actual performance, they were far behind my Blackberry Z3. Onething I noticed was the quality of pictures and movies taken with its 8mp only camera. You can notice the true difference when you transfer the image to your laptop and zoom. (Even after 5 years, that phone works fine even without battery change ).Dissatisfied with the performance of Chinese toys, I again moved to blackberry evolve few months back. In my experience I have found that although different brands offer same specifications, in actual performance, they differ widely, may be because of the quality of components. This can be the reason , yu get better pictures with an 8mp camera or a long battery life and a hassle free performance in the long run., even though many popular brands offer same spec. In my view, Evolve  offersGood BatteryPremium look - Back cover looks like leather and also offer fine grip even if ur hands are wet.Dolby Digital Stereo produces high quality sound.Great Display - Minimal strain on eyes.Camera quality is fine, but needs third-party camera apps for good quality pictures.

I was very happy with my previous phone, but after heavy usage for 1.5 years - the battery started to drain in less than 4-5 hours straight. The samsung service center in Ahmedabad could not arrange a replacement battery for the last 3 months. It was time to move on. Here are my observations:Pros:1) BB Hub is awesome. Brings some sanity to the life in these times of multiple online accounts.2) Phone is a head-turner and a conversation starter. Stands apart in the crowd of bar phones.3) Android M update was immediately available.4) Battery life is superb. Though these are early days - I am getting a little over 27 hours every-time for the first week.5) The screen is huge. Even if you do not open the slider too often, you have enough real estate to live with the on screen keyboard.6) The device feels sturdy and premium. At the current cost it is a good VFM.Cons:1) Camera is nothing compared to the flagships from Samsung. My S6 Edge was unbeatable in this department.Worse than that, the image processing is worse.2) The physical keyboard is cramped. Not as good as a typical BB phone.3) The screen is not even nearly as bright as the offerings from Samsung. At full brightness, it feels as if there was scope for more. Maybe, my eyes are tuned to a Samsung display for years and hence the feeling.4) I know that I have bought a phone for 35k, that would not have any resale value in 6 - 9 months.

With the hub and other features inplace, the shift to Android has been seamless. But it is not a scratch on the BB10 OS. Marshmallow got updated. Buy it", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "28 Oct 2016,"], ["Well i got my priv a fortnight back. Had been eyeing this phone for a long time but stayed away because of its high price. The increased app gap in my previous BlackBerry Classic was the main driver for me to move to an Android device as i am not an iPhone person and find it as one of the many slab phones that are available in the market, insanely priced and for the iPhone wannabes.\n\nThe Android phone market is huge. There are many brands that have better specs than priv. They are probably faster too. To think of it, 6 months down the line the phones that are beating BlackBerry priv presently will get beaten by the future phones in the race of specs. So i zeroed on the requirement and got the priv because - a) it has a pkb. B) has a decent 3gb ram works fine with me. I have over 100 consumer apps and the phone is handling them quite well. I am not a game person so don't know if 3gb ram can delivery decent performance on 3d games. C) expandae memory :- gives me the freedom to expand when in need of extra memory space(upto 2 tb of data). D) priv is not a regular device that you will find with many. Its kinda exclusive and stands out in the sea of all slab phones. It s damn good looking phone and gets quite a lot of attention. 5) get an access to all blackberry app that i have always been used to. 6) decent battery 3410 mah. 7) liked the idea of slider (having vkb + pkb together in a phone)\n\nI am thoroly enjoying using my priv and i have had no post purchase desonance at all.\n\nNow some points for pple who are considering to buy priv :- ensure you buy a priv model that's stv100-3 which is compatible to all 4g bands in india. Ensure you get this clarified with your seller before you buy one. Stv100-1 is an US model and works in all 3g in india but not with airtel 4g. Jio also needs band 40(2300) to operate and stv100-1 supports volte only thro jio apps and not independently. Stv100-3 the official india phone and works all across Asia Pacific and works fine in US, EU and UK too in their 4g bands.\n\nNow a last few points on what i found good in the phone that i wasn't aware of - a) there are various shortcuts in the pkb - u can use them in hub to do things faster. B) curved screen - offers a battery charging status and also have productivity tab offering quick access to contacts, tasks and unread mails of the hub. C) home button shortcut for 3 fav apps. D) moving ur fingers on pkb will move the screen without having to touch the screen just like a laptop touch pad. Well you can also do typing by merely touching the pkb - a function tho not very much used by me till date. E) the phone is slim and not too heavy - good to hold. F) regular monthly security updates by BlackBerry - i have heard that BlackBerry is working on moving priv to Android 7 and if that happens it will be fantastic!! G) pic quality from the rear camera is just fantastic!! Good low light pics. H) i was concerned about the smaller keypad in comparison to classic but in about say a week's time - i was absolutely comfortable using it.\n\nNow finally on why i didn't give the 5 stars to priv. Because of a) non availability of the dual sim b . B) not giving a charger in the bundle thats capable of quick charging. C) the round edges in the phones make one use the phone better with single hand use.  Priv has right angle corners/edges and makes single hand use not easy. D) the edge screen doesn't offer widgets like samsung where some kind of scroller could be configured. I guess its a software function and i hope BlackBerry actually sends update to make use of its curved screen in a better way. E) for many, 2mp front camera will be a problem - it doesn't matter to me as i seldom use the front camera.\n\nOverall phone built quality is good with almost no lag. I will recommend this phone highly if you manage to get it in a good price. N yes i will never pay the full price 62k for this phone or for that matter any phone!! I paid around 36 and had bought from a non Amazon Marketplace that doesn't have a customer feedback  / review option hence i thought of sharing it here with you all considering to buy a priv", "0 users found this review helpful", "4 stars", "26 Oct 2016,"], ["Great phone with physical keyboard.now specifications are one year old,but still works best for Blackberry diehards.", "0 users found this review helpful", "3 stars", "25 Oct 2016,"], ["You will love this product...!!!\n\nWhats is different ?\n\nSlider\nPhysical keyboard\nSamsung edge like display\n\nWhy should I buy it?\n\nAmazing display\nAndroid in BB\n\nWhat could be better?\nBattery life\nFront cam\n\nFinal verdict: Go for it if you want to stand out from the crowd", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "23 Oct 2016,"], ["Excellent product", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "23 Oct 2016,"], ["Beautiful phone.

Unfortunately, it has launched just weeks before the entire Android world will be refreshed, with every top company expected to launch a new flagship at MWC 2016 in late February. The Priv will look a lot like last year's news very soon.\nThat said, the hardware is still quite strong. There's a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor, with six CPU cores, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage with the option of up to 2TB more using a microSDXC card, LTE support on Indian frequencies, NFC, GPS, and dual-band Wi-Fi ac. The display measures 5.43 inches diagonally and has a resolution of 1440x2560 pixels.\nThe Micro-USB port on the bottom supports SlimPort accessories such as video output adapters.\n\n[Look and feel]\nThe Priv immediately feels like a super-premium device, but this is more about its build quality than its looks. At first glance, it doesn't have the \"wow\" factor that, for example, the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge has, but that changes the instant you flick the screen up to reveal the keyboard. The front is nearly all glass, with curved edges on the sides.\nA large BlackBerry logo is placed front and centre above the screen, with a programmable multi-colour notification LED the front camera further to the right. When the screen is off and the phone is plugged in, you'll see a coloured bar indicating the current charge percentage along the screen's right edge. Apart from this, there is no real way in which BlackBerry has integrated the curves into its software or user experience.\nBeneath the sliding screen is a lip that lets you push it up with one hand. The power button is on the left and the volume buttons are on the right.\nThe phone's rear has a carbon fibre finish which is smooth but still easy to grip. There's a thick silver ring around the camera lens, which protrudes quite a bit from the rear. The two-tone LED flash is right next to it. The Nano-SIM and microSD trays are located on the top of the phone's lower half, while the Micro-USB port and 3.5mm socket are on the bottom.\n\n[Software and Usage]\n    Android 5.1.1 Lollipop\n    BlackBerry Hub\n    Gesture controls\n    BlackBerry's DTEK security software\nRather than fork Android, which other companies have attempted to do, BlackBerry has gone with the whole Google package, apps and all. The Priv runs Android 5.1.1. There are lots of tweaks and modifications, but surprisingly not a custom skin that might replicate the BB10 experience more faithfully. To the casual user, BlackBerry's involvement in the software of the Priv won't seem any deeper than other manufacturers go, with just a few preloaded apps and cosmetic touches.\nThat said, there are security-centric features under the hood. BlackBerry knows what its enterprise and corporate customers demand - as we've been told, the name \"Priv\" comes from \"privilege\" and \"privacy\". BlackBerry promises that it has \"hardened\" Android to protect your data and defend against malware and intrusion attempts. An app called DTEK gives you an overview of your security settings and what your apps have been up to.\nThe first thing you'll notice on the Android homescreen is the trademark red BlackBerry \"splat\" badge on app icons, letting you know that you have notifications. While eye-catching, you lose the ability to see how many notifications you have in each app. The badge has also been incorporated into the notifications on the lockscreen and in the pull-down shade: a strip of icons along the top lets you see alerts for each individual app or phone function, and for some reason there is a numerical count next to each one here, even though they're much smaller.\nIn addition to widgets and app icons, you can have shortcut icons on the homescreens as well. These are very handy, but could confuse some users. These help you perform specific actions, and have descriptive names such as \"Check battery level\", \"Turn Wi-Fi on/off\", \"Schedule BBM meeting\", and \"Text contact\". This still doesn't quite make up for the relatively sparse selection of quick toggles in the notifications shade.\nOne very neat feature is that you can call up homescreen widgets related to specific apps by swiping up or down on their icons. This lets you quickly pull up your Chrome favourites or VLC's playback controls, see messages between you and a particular contact, or even check the contents of your Google Drive. It's really convenient and lets you avoid cluttering up your homescreens. The app drawer scrolls vertically, and there are tabs for widgets and shortcuts beyond what you choose to have outside on the homescreens.\n\n[The keyboard]\nThe Priv's biggest draw is obviously its keyboard, but there is definitely a bit of a disconnect between the device's hardware and software when it comes to actually using it, because BlackBerry has tried to cater to its legacy users as well as new ones who are already familiar with Android. You can also assign shortcuts to each letter and activate them just by long-pressing that key, like on any classic BlackBerry. Shortcuts within the Hub also work as expected.\nAs far as typing comfort goes, the keyboard is excellent. It isn't as large or spaced out as the legendary Bold series' keyboards, but it has the right contours and you can get used to it in no time. It flexes a little in the centre, but that won't slow you down.\n\n[Performance and Gaming]\n    64-bit Hexa-Core Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 SoC\n    32GB of internal storage; 3GB of RAM\n    Up to 2TB expandable storage\nThe BlackBerry Priv handles itself very well, and we wouldn't have expected anything less considering its pedigree. Day-to-day tasks posed no problem, and we found ourselves much more at ease moving around Android than we ever did with BB10 - though of course BlackBerry loyalists will need time to get used to it. The only problem was that the middle-rear of the phone got hot even when we were doing absolutely mundane things like setting up email accounts.\nBenchmark scores were good: we got 60,780 in AnTuTu and 22,271 in Quadrant. 3DMark's Ice Storm Extreme preset was maxed out, and the Unlimited preset gave us 19,288. Similarly, I saw 24fps in GFXbench which reflected the smooth gameplay , I was able to get in 3D titles such as Dead Trigger 2. There's more than enough horsepower for all your business and road warrior needs.\n\n[Enertainment]\nHowever, BlackBerry is also touting the Priv's entertainment capabilities, and in light of that we have to say the screen was great in terms of sharpness, brightness, and colour reproduction. However, reflections on the curved sides made it difficult to enjoy gaming and movies except in darkened rooms. The speaker on the bottom is excellent, pushing loud, rich sound that didn't distort even at high volumes.\n\n[Camera]\n    18-megapixel camera\n    2-megapixel front-facing camera\n    4K video recording at 30 frames per second, 1080p at 60 frames per second\nOne of BlackBerry's core focuses for the Priv is the camera, and it's equipped the handset with an 18MP Schneider Kreuznach sensor on the rear. The camera itself is a sizable presence on the back of the Priv, protruding from the tensile weave back cover and accompanied by a dual-LED flash to one side. BlackBerry highlights the DSLR-like qualities of the Priv's camera, which boasts a high frame rate and fast focusing. . The front camera is only 2 megapixels, so don't expect great-looking shots or video calls from it.\n\nThe camera app is a bit cluttered, and requires multiple taps to do basic things like switching to video recording. I liked the fact that the slide-out keyboard gave us a good grip when taking photos, and the spacebar acts as a shutter too. You get live filters, a panorama mode, a timer, and an option to crop to 1:1 square photos. Picture quality was good, but not especially impressive considering this phone's status as a flagship. Daytime shots felt a little washed out, and fine details didn't quite make it when examining photos at full size. The front camera is quite awful, but 4K videos taken with the rear camera looked good.\n\n[Battery]\nThere's a 3410mAh (non-removable) battery with Quick Charge 2.0, but the bundlded charger does not support quick charging.\nBattery life was excellent. We ran through at least a day and a half with multiple email and messaging accounts active, a bit of gaming and video playback, and plenty of 4G data usage.\n\n[PROS:]\nThe 5.4-inch QHD display on the Priv is excellent. Its subtle dual curved edges are attractive, detail is pin sharp and it enables you to actually enjoy videos and games on a BlackBerry device.\n\nI'm also a big fan of stock Android, which BlackBerry has only altered in a couple of minor ways, while adding a smattering of its own applications. It's clean, clutter-free and enjoyable to use.\n\nThe added security will be a big plus point for many, with the Priv able to show you how to improve the privacy of the handset - and that's after BlackBerry has done additional work to secure both the hardware and software.\n\nThe Priv lacks the premium design to match its premium price tag, but even though the plastic is a bit creaky on the rear I'm quite taken with its stylings. It offers something a bit different - and I could play with that slider all day.\n\nBattery life was excellent.\n\n[CONS]\nThe front camera is only 2 megapixels,\n\nWhile the Android Marshmallow update has improved things considerably, the Priv still isn't what you'd call a speedy performer. It's just a little too slow for a truly great on-screen experience, with noticeable lag in areas such as the camera app.\n\n[VERDICT]\nDon't get me wrong - I really, really like the BlackBerry Priv. It's a great high-end Android phone, especially when you consider who's made it.\n\nFinally we have a BlackBerry smartphone with all the apps you want, with a screen you can actually enjoy videos and games on, and an interface that's far more familiar and intuitive (for the general public at least) than that on the BlackBerry 10.\n\nTrouble is, I wanted to love the Priv - and this is a phone that BlackBerry really needs people to love if the company's ever going to get back into the consumer hardware market - but I just don't.\n\nThe occasionally flaky (though improved) performance and absence of a properly premium design, coupled with a price tag that still makes it more expensive than its contemporaries as well as some top new upper-mid-range contenders, makes the BlackBerry Priv very difficult to recommend over its closest rivals.\n\nIt's by far the best phone BlackBerry has produced in recent years - but once again I can't help but feel that it's just too little, too late.", "0 users found this review helpful", "4 stars", "17 Oct 2016,"], ["Seal was tampered with.

The second set was all better- but the issue with the raised gap came back in a week or so.I'm not sure if the manufacturing standards had gone low nowadays.

I used a an iPhone 4S way back some 4 yrs ago for no more than 6 months.  I used an S4 also for no ore than 1.5 yrs. But through the past nearly 20 yrs, I had been satisfied and stuck initially with Nokia (dropped motrola within weeks), and there after Blackberry curve alongside apple and Samsung until Z30 came in, then Passport, then Classic and now the best in Smart Workhorse System (Priv - that mixes Android's colours with professional brute of Blackberry logic and sturdy system).  I found Passport exceptionally good in all aspects.  There are some apps which work only on Android, which one misses.  But I should say, that if the Passport gets Android apps, it will get no match from any of the aspiring competitors (Nexus, Samsung, Apple etc) at least for the next 2 yers.

If one gives a phone to monkey, keep it simple, it will be just as good, may be better than all its competitors, perhaps just like Nokia.  But if you give a smart phone to a monkey, it wont understand.  The Blackberry is not just a phone, or a smart phone, it is a System, a gadget that is a whole brute workstation which wont get tired end of the dya, not even end of a few years.  It is robust like German, trusted like German systems, but priced like a Canadian does.  Canadians or the RIM do not know marketing and sales. They are poor at it.  The others have sold monkey-nuts calling it cashews and you know who would fall for it.  The Blackberry has a specific but professionally inclined intelligent user who exploits it for a variety of uses. Even today, the curve is not out of popular market.  It is still relevant.  If there is anything that Blackberry missed out, it was the gloss which others threw.  Now that BB brought the gloss from the Z series, screen became a selling point for the two giants Samsung and Apple.  BB gave the screen resolution also and left nothing more to compare with for the two.  BB has the strongest power and speed ratio.  It is not a glorified camera, but a Passport shoots better photos than the S5/S6 and iPhone 5.  Not used iPhone 6, which in anycase under performs to Passport and Priv.\n\nSo if someone wants an INR 60k-80k camera with a phone, they perhaps know no more than mobile phone and camera.

Which is much higher price than available in India.\n\nFirst of all, I   m a diehard fan of BlackBerry, however never used it earlier, so was anxious when it   ll launch android based phone. Once I got the news don   t get delay at all. Grab that immediately. And being a fan of that Signature Company it   s quite true there are chances to be diluted most of the cons to me.\n\nNot even comparing with other Brands, while I   ve used Samsung, iphone, moto g3 etc. as all are different with different configurations and I believe everything depending upon how individual is spending over that. One set of 10,000/- cannot be possible to compare with a 50,000/- range handset. But almost same price tag may be compared with or with same configuration what brand is selling with how much price range.\n\nThere are so many technical pros & cons may be found on other reviews, I   m not worried with these critics or appreciations although.

Excellent photo quality for main camera with such storage.\n10. Same too good video quality. With brilliant images and screen viewing. It   s pleasure of eyes.\n11. Touch is superior.\n12. Curvey edge added beautification in it. However, not having any special function on it, except showing charging level, during charging only.\n13. Having two types of keyboard, on screen and physical both giving advantage and comfortability of uses.\n14. BBM is available with all other signature apps.\n15. No extra costs for net connection unlike earlier of the brand.\n16. All google trade mark apps (like     youtube, maps, google+, drive etc.) all are available inbuilt with the set. Working smoothly too.\n17. Every useful apps (my apps are around 35 to 40 nos. in total) are smoothly working without any trouble or giving woes.\n18. Password keeper also available. Too useful to keep all passwords of several email ids or banking sites or any social media or apps in a single place. I personally kept more than 50 passwords of different uses as off now. Don   t worry itself it   s password protected.\n\nDissatisfaction    \n1. Get hot while charging.\n2. Front camera worthless while price tag too high.\n3. Not having any function on the edges.\n4.

The battery life isnt great. I unplug the phone from charger at 9:30 am and by 6:00pm the battery drains out completely. The battery is nowhere as good as that of the passport.\n\n3. The Hub has been downgraded to an app and it no longer serves in the same way as that in the passport.\n\nAlso, the User Interface is a MEGA disappointment! They have shipped the standard UI of stock android which gives it the same look and feel as that of low range Android phones. I would have appreciated had Blackberry developed better icons similar to how Samsung does on its phones. I have downloaded Apus Launcher to console myself from the plain jane stock Android UI.\n\nOverall I am really disappointed! Its like Blackberry was forced to marry with Android and in the process it has become like a submissive spouse to a dominating partner without any identity of itself! A real disappointment for any loyal blackberry user.\n\nI spent a fortune on this phone (nearly 60k+) and I am really regretting my decision as Samsung S7 edge would have been a much better choice and I would have got Gear VR free along with it. :-/\n\nFINAL VERDICT: It gives a feeling of just a stock Android phone with Blackberry Logo embossed on it.\n-----\nUPDATE: After using the phone for 6 months now, have more positive things to say.\n\n1. The build quality is very solid - have dropped the phone umpteen times, nothing happened.\n2. QWERTY missing features have been added after update such as long press for CAPS\n3. Battery life is still the same (not great though) but it hasn't deteriorated how it does for other phones after few months of usage\n4. Phone doesn't hang and there is a lag only occasionally.\n5. The Hub is still pretty useless, prefer the native apps rather than using the hub.\n\nOverall the phone grows on you. Not regretting buying it as much as I was earlier.

A lot of Blackberry magic have been carried down to an alien OS that Android is to Blackberry. I am truly impressed with the end consumer experience. With judicious choice of what one needs and what are disposable( a subjective referral point), I get well over 24 hours of battery life. Admittedly, the device tends to easily warm up in your palm; an undesirable spin off from Snapdragon 808. To my relief it is less warm in your hands than another flagship carrying the same SOC! I am sure, with the advent of Android Marshmallow anytime soon, we will see this phenomenon disappear with better battery life and snappier performance. The Physical keyboard takes a few days of constant use to get familiar with owing to a closer key configuration the design warrants. But, once that stage is overcome, it is a sheer joy to keep flicking the suggested words up. Adding up to the brilliance of the keyboard, we can as well customise the level of artificial intelligence in terms of word predictability! Lastly, the cameras. They performs as well as a Blackberry passport does and sadly nothing better. But Passport camera is not disappointing by any stretch of imagination.

Love for the interface - A bravia like screen with super smart looking icons, Xperia UI is indeed charming.However, the performance and configuration is not as good as other handsets of this range. My priority wasnt gaming and movies, i wanted a good looking smart and sharp looking gadget. In case you are a techie, solely looking for a performance driven handset, this is probably not the item you are looking for. I have been using this for 2 weeks and dont see any instances of touch screen issues others on this forum are complaining of. For me, it was an easy choice as Xperia has given me good experience in the past.

Now, I am facing issues with touch. Even after 3 serious issues the company is not willing to replace the set. They say our policy allows only repair, not replacement. That's unacceptable from such a premium brand. It   s quite clear Sony has resorted to making substandard products for cost-cutting.

I wanted to take a look at it first. Personally.And so I went to my nearest Sony phone retailer to take a look at it and..This phone is GORGEOUS. Like, PROPERGORGEOUS. I know looks are very subjective but.. this phone is \"tremendously\" beautiful. With its screen, the feel of the buttons,the loop design... It's a complete beauty. I HAD to order this phone that night itself.It's a GREAT phone, alright? WORTH THE BUY. (if you want to hear it right away)I have always been a fan of compact phones, and this was perfect in that sense aswell.1. The screen is great. It might be \"just HD\" but aren't you noticing the 5 inch screen aswell?It has a decent 294 ppi and the screen is great.The \"borderless screen\" is just.. beautiful. I can't stop saying good stuff about its screen or looks. I just can't.2. Battery? It's GREAT. \"Just\" 2300 mAh, you may ask? But aren't you looking at the 5 inch screen and a \"non-juice sucking\" processor? And that \"just an HD\" screen? The backup is great. Trust me. Actually better than most 3k mAh range battery bois.3. Camera? (This is going to be the best part)IT. IS. JUST. MIND. BLOWING.IT'S AMAZINGGGGG. 23MP guys. Sony. Exmor RS   . F2.0? Aren't you getting it already? Mind blowing. The colours might get just a bit too over saturated sometimes but my god, the colour reproduction is great. The sharpness is stunning. It has a manual focus as well. Now, you don't get that normally at this price, do you?I own an A5 2017 (30k when I bought it) as well. It doesn't have it. Most budget phones don't.  This beauty has that. The photos are wide as well. The camera is actually one of its strongest points.What else..Yeah, it doesn't lag. It's fast. I personally like the Sony interface. It's snappy.Aaaaaand, I have never had any issue with the touch as well (Despite the complaints from other people). Maybe I was just lucky but.. mine didn't have any issue with the touch.BUT. Should you buy it now? In 2018? I'll say no. And you know why?Because... its bigger brother, the XA2 is going to come to India somewhere in late March. Go look it up. It has a fingerprint scanner, a 5.2\" screen, a FULL HD screen, and a straight 1k mAh boost in the battery (it has 3300 mAh). What else would you need?So, if you are planning to get it now, the XA1, don't. Wait for sometime. That's what I am doing, haha! I am waiting for its release SO BADLY. I WANT THE XA2!Summing it all up,This phone looks premium, has a great battery, a good screen, a \"scaringly\" amazing camera (both rear and front  [THE REAR CAMERA THOUGH]), doesn't lag, is fast..Just amazing.The drawback(s)..Umm. The speaker is a little low in sound for my taste?It gets a bit heated up after some proper usage,  but it's not a great deal at all.Not waterproof but well, 20k price as well. (I personally like waterproof phones but..I'll still buy the XA2 because of..well, what it is)It doesn't have a fingerprint scanner, but it was honestly no big deal for me at all. (Might be to some people out there)XA1 deserves a solid 4.5 stars for sure. Not worth the buy now (because of XA2) but is a great all-rounder.I HAD to post this review. This phone's rating on Amazon has always been around 2.8-3 stars mark. It definitely deserves more.

Conventional, rather than a disaster.Playing back a 720p test video for 90 minutes, the Xperia XA1 loses 27%. That   s significantly worse than the  Moto G5, which loses 22% in the same test.The message is pretty clear: having a 720p screen doesn   t entirely make up for the low-capacity battery. However, the bright backlight does not help either. We perform these tests at maximum brightness, and on the Xperia XA1 that   s pretty bright.With real life use you   ll be able to get a full day of  moderate  use between charges. However, we tend to oscillate between moderate and heavy use, and like this the Sony Xperia XA1 struggles a little. Add a few hours of podcast streaming and the battery is likely to conk out at or just before bedtime.However, it seems better than last year   s  Xperia XA, perhaps because the chipset is more efficient.It has worse stamina than the Moto G5, if not by a truly dramatic margin. There is a mode to help out, too, called Stamina. This restricts background data and switches off features like GPS and (photo/video) Image Enhancement to lower power use.There   s also an Ultra Power Saver mode, but as this effectively makes the Sony Xperia XA1 a feature phone, you won   t want to use it much.The phone uses a USB-C socket to charge, giving it another modern design edge to laud over the Moto G5, which uses micro USB.Not every part of the Sony Xperia XA1 is a winner, but its camera is among the very best at the price. The rear camera uses a 23MP sensor of 1/2.3-inch size, the same scale as some dedicated compact cameras.For a phone at this price, detail and general image quality is excellent. We had a chance to shoot alongside the  Sony Xperia XZ Premium, and while the results were a little different, with the Premium creating warmer-looking shots, you   d never guess one phone was almost three times the price of the other.The Sony Xperia XA1 also benefits from Sony   s super-aggressive brightening of night photos. While the camera isn   t properly stabilized, which is essential for truly great night shots in a phone, it   ll make night shots clearer than most phones at the price. Just don   t expect amazing detail at night too.The value/price of Sony   s 23MP sensors must be dropping rapidly, because this is a pretty low-cost phone for one with so many megapixels.After all that praise, we have to deal with the problems with the Sony Xperia XA1   s images. There are plenty, most of which were present in Xperia flagships of years gone by.First, the processing style is not good. The Xperia XA1 uses far too much sharpening, making fine details look stressed and unnatural up close. Image quality also goes down the toilet towards the extreme edges of the frame, turning mushy.", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "27 Sep 2017,"], ["I thought it to be quite a good decision to buy this phone from amazon. initially i was overwhelmed using this phone but day by day i got to witness its true colour .and now its touch totally stopped working and its screen got hard", "0 users found this review helpful", "1 stars", "27 Sep 2017,"], ["Handy + Nice", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "27 Sep 2017,"], ["Not working as expected hangs a lot", "0 users found this review helpful", "2 stars", "26 Sep 2017,"], ["NICE ONE", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "26 Sep 2017,"], ["My device not working properly reported display issue its been resolved...

In smart check, it shows my first slim slot is empty and second slim slot has JIO sim card, which is wrong actually. There was JIO in 1st slot and Vodafone in second slot. Smart check showed no other complaints, to my dismay.Later I observed that phone was stable and receiving signals when connected to wifi. When I turn off wifi, sim cards were also going offline.Finally Amazon agreed to replace the phone with new one, they promised that the phone will be thoroughly checked before delivery. They picked up the phone and again delivered the new phone on time.Unfortunately, the replacement phone is also defective, with all the above mentioned problems.In addition, when I select 1st sim for data, it gets jumbled on its own and phone starts using data from second sim.

Delivery was on time like always (Amazon never disappointed on product delivery).was looking for a mobile upto 20000 rupees. and Redmi note 4, Vivo V5s, Sony Xperia XA1. were among the top choices.Finally decided for This one and luckily got this for 18500 that day (Actual price between 19500-20000+)there  was no mobile with 23mp camera in this price with volte service.yes other mobiles have 4 gb ram or 64gb memory or like 3000+mAh battery, Finger Print Sensor and all that. BUTSony XA1 has Mixed reviews on all websites by users. which were like1.Camera not good enough (False)2.Lags (False)3.Heating Issue/Burns (False)4.Battery not enough (False)5.No Finger Print Sensor (i Personally don't care for that, i am not providing my finger print to companies for free!)6.Call drops/Low Speaker Volume (False)7.Touch Issue  \"i was worried about\"  (False)8.Slippery (it is Carbon Fiber guys NOT Plastic. mobile is not wide like others and screen is touching sides. i would recommend using a Cover/Flip Cover )9. Space between sides (False) (i saw none) (it is not Water proof guys)so explaining a little bit more here:1. Mobile is Carbon Fiber Finish so it is not heavy and looks classy while holding.2. screen is almost touching sides so it is not wide on sides. so it is easy to hold in one hand and also great while typing. it is a joy to hold this one in hand.3.i played \"Clash of clans and Asphalt nitro\" (2 Hours Continuous). games known for Heating Mobiles and Sucking Battery. and what i found was battery went from 91% to 85% in Two hours (Wifi Connection + COC). That is Good enough i guess. and another thing i notice that app management is too good and phone battery drains very very very slowly if it is sitting ideal (although apps running in background)And Talking About HEAT. i Felt just like 0 to 2% increase in warmness of Mobile while gaming continuously with wifi on! that is same as mobile gets warm while charging. and as soon as you close the game. it gets back to 0. it is almost not noticeable. also there was no fan or air cooling system around me while i was playing game and it was a sunny day (summer days).Even after gaming 2 Hours Phone managed to get through night and i charged in next day near 11 am.So battery is all very good guys it will easily get through the day after 2 hours of gaming and whole day on social media.i didn't charged the mobile today and battery was at 18% in the morning. since then i have played COC for a few minutes, Instagram, facebook, gmail i have used. and it is 6:05 PM i am writing this review and Mobile still has 5% battery left in it. (Good Enough??)4. Camera is 23mp rear and 8 mp front. Some people said it is not good enough. but to them if it is not good enough.. nothing will be in this range of 20000. in day light this camera has no match i have tested it. even it is too bright light in the view just focus on something dark appearing on screen and see the magic. believe me guys, this is really good camera phone. even in a room which is at the innermost corner of house in the evening (no natural light) with flash on this mobile clicks a clear picture. i am totally satisfied with its camera.5. Display is really good and with manual brightness it can be easily seen in bright day (Kept at half the brightness is good in both day and night time). Touch is flawless and you enjoy touching the screen while typing.6. Preinstalled apps consumes almost no battery in mobile that is very well managed.7. when i received mobile firstly i checked for system updates and there were two updates in a row with 140MB and 108mb almost8. Sound is very clear and Solid. even it is high enough to listen songs in a noisy environment.This is a must Buy guys if your budget is upto 20000. this is a master piece by Sony.Thank you Sony for this amazing product and Thank you amazon for quick Delivery.

I have not installed facebook and whatsapp.Only one game was installed, subway surfer.Battery is pretty good. Bluetooth, WiFi, internet connection and Location services are on for all day time, 8-8. I start with 100 percent and end with 65-70 percentages. It covers 15-20 minutes call, 30 minutes music on FM / stored music, 10-12 emails, 5-6 SMS, 4-5 pics and 5-7 minutes of Hangout. Screen brightness is around 50 percentages.Sunlight visibility is pretty fine. Screen looks crispy even if it is 720 P.Picture quality is 70-75 / 100 [it is not great in front of 950]. Esp in dark, it is quite grainy. Focusing is issue in dark.Call quality is good, but network reception is relatively not so good. Where my 950 was giving me full towers, this will give me 2 or 3 / 4. But still can hear well with those numbers too.Music and video reveals good loudness of speaker. [actually 950 was pretty poor for it].Ring notifications has to be choose wisely, as you will miss 2 times out of ten.I have idea sim, internet works absolutely fine for anything above 2 towers on signal reception.CONS : Sometimes videos stutter and gives green blocks at HD video quality in you tube.

It encompasses with Octa-core (4  2.3 GHz Cortex-A53 & 4  1.6 GHz Cortex-A53) processor  It is equipped with Mediatek MT6757 Helio P20 Chipset  Brings an internal memory of 32 GB and expandable memory supported with upto 256 GB  Comes with 23 MP rear camera and 8 MP front facing camera and with additional features like phase detection and laser autofocus, LED flash, 1/2.3    sensor size, geo-tagging, touch focus, face/smile detection, HDR, panorama  Its display has good pixel density for its resolution (~294 ppi pixel density) which is required.

Device is missing the basic Finger print sensor, which is very common even in the low ranged mobiles.  Secondary camera need to be improved.  Comes as a Non Removable Battery Device.  Battery capacity is very poor.  It even comes with less no. of sensors#########################################CONCLUSIONWhen you consider the amount of technology you are getting with both the Sony Xperia XA1 and XA1 Ultra, both of these phones are excellent value for money.Sony has done a great job of offering a specification, which while not    flagship   , does what most people want.OK, the processor is not the latest or most powerful, but it is able to deal with the most commonly used apps.  The interface is responsive, and rarely did I experience any slowdown unless pushing the phone hard. The 3 / 4GB of RAM help here.The 23-megapixel camera supplied with both of these phones give superb results.  In many cases exceeding the capabilities of more expensive smartphones. Sony   s Exmor RS mobile image sensor and f/2.0 lens, deliver plenty of light in photos.  These give good results on both clear days and more challenging conditions.Video recording is also good with clear imagery, but there appears no option to record 4K content. This is an omission which many may find surprising due to the capabilities of the camera. Obviously, Sony has their reasons for doing this, but it is a shame it is not included.Overall, both of these both are good options to buy if you are thinking about buying a mid-range phone.Would I buy one?  That is an interesting question and the answer to it is most likely yes if I were in this market. They both look good and offer a lot to the average buyer. Due to my own personal tastes, I would opt for the smaller Sony Xperia XA1.", "0 users found this review helpful", "4 stars", "15 Jun 2017,"], ["Best mobile phone", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "12 Jun 2017,"], ["Don't buy any Sony phone     Bakwas battery     Heat too much     Performance 0 lag a lot.Mainncone battery backup of any Sony phone 3 to 4 hr on screen", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "12 Jun 2017,"], ["Don't buy this phone..

Fingerprint scanner sometimes annoys us saying \" fingerprint doesn't match \" (Whereas other mobiles like Xiomi works flawlessly under 10k budget range models).2. The Ui isn't stable . Thought the Ui is similar to iOS,it fails to handle it.3. The phone gets heated up pretty fast (Sometimes I feel as if it may blast like the Xiomi and Galaxy devices ).4. You'll get double notifications in the notification bar which makes us annoying (Trust me.No other phone got this feature).5.

Smooth, no stutter, I don't see any flaws in it.- 5 inch screen.- I don't really like the round fingerprint sensor at the back of many phones like honor 6x or Coolpad A8 or a list of such phones; it looks cheap to me. So for me the front fingerprint scanner is a good feel with amazing functionality.- All in all this is a great device to have under 15k with premium feel, decent camera but exception performance.

Almost a year later as its price dropped I considered it and read a lot of reviews that would not give this device a chance. Not sure about the users in the 20k+ range but for the current price tag it is a killer deal. I generally do not buy products with bad reviews but something was really wrong to read about a phone using Snapdragon 820 coupled with 4 GB RAM not performing well and so went ahead and ordered it.I was pleasantly surprised by the package containing a sturdy looking phone(while using the Matte Back cover in box) and a snappy UI. My last one was a Moto G Turbo which is a pretty good phone and i have no complaints upgrading to this one. Of course, the only disappointment was the absence of In-Box earphones which is a basic accessory that every phone should come with. Would have been a 5-Star if it was included.Again, I am user who doesn't use my phone for heavy gaming but just for daily chores such as banking, wallets, emails, news and social networking. This phone never lagged once or heated up while doing these even for extended periods(On Wi-Fi most of the time). And the battery lasted easily for 24 hours before i plugged it in at around 20%.

I knew it was a software problem*slow app install speed, even with fast internal storage. Again,  optimisation required.*Fingerprint scanner is SLOW as compared to others like RN4,  although very accurate*Battery backup was normal even with such smaller screen*the glass back got scratched rather easily I won't point out the pros though you can find it anywhere. So 4 stars..... But now! (geek stuff ahead)After installing a custom rom (AEX,  I suggest, screenshot attached) this phone is a real beast in terms of performance, battery backup, customisation, even the fingerprint sensor is kinda fast now. Apart from UTouch's best functionality of switching between apps really fast you get everything. And LOTS of options to cover up for that.. For example the bottom button navigation bar in AEX rom can perform 12  operations!! Not 5, not 6 but 12.. Camera is really not bad, storage is fast enough allowing very quick apps install and load times, files transfer etc.  Battery backup is increased by almost 30-40 percent.Remaining the scratch prone glass back. It looks better then any other matte metallic finish even with the scratches, Go coverless B-) I own an Honor 8 pro(30k price best camera i've seen ever)  and I am using it as just a camera.

Plus the enetire body is made of gorilla glass 3, which gives a great protection in addition to the zuk guard that it came with, even the stock screen guard is too good.The touch is quite nice specially the touch controls are just loveable.Lastly what many people donot understand is how to measure backup quality.

It is one button for 3, easily relatable to Motorola G5.The display is sharp and accurate. It is bright enough to be legible outdoors in direct sunlight.Though auto brightness is annoying, I reccomend turning it off.Build quality: Glass back and front, metal alloy sides.

The notification bar in Moto is highly functional - you can reply to emails/ chats, dismiss reminders and alarms, disconnect calls, etc. from the notification bar. This phone had none of those things. What I found the most irritating was that there was no \"search\" functionality in messages. Additionally, they have loaded the phone with useless apps like weather, which you can't uninstall.

I really like the near stock Android experience of Moto with things like active display and Moto actions. However, z2+ had a lot of good reviews online and was available at an amazing price of 11k (+1k cashback). I don't believe in spending excessively on a mobile and instead prefer to upgrade every couple of years so I decided to take a chance with this.Pros:# I really like the form factor and the compact screen size.# Personally, I like the weight.# Absolutely no issues with running any app.# Battery life on stock ROM was decent. I was getting maybe 4.5~5hrs of SOT# Got nougat update# Phone cover and screen guard came bundled# Charger is good. It's not a fast charger but typically takes <2.5hrs to charge from 0-100%.# I had a lot of micro usb cables so was apprehensive to upgrade to usb type-c but I am happy to report that it was worth it. The connector is now reversible and connection is very solid unlike micro usb connectors, which tend to get loose pretty fast.Cons:# It is hard to put in words just how bad the stock ZUI ROM really is. The navigation is non intuitive, you actually might have to use Google to locate some menus. Notifications are absolutely crap (and irritating).# The bundled screen guard makes the display look dull so please replace it as soon as possible.# Protection of the screen is not clear as it is not gorilla.# I noticed back heating occasionally (not persistently).# The contacts menu was showing multiple duplicates.# Battery life should have been much better considering the huge amperage and small screen size.# No earphones in the box.# No sd card slot (not a deal breaker for me).Frustrated, I was forced to look for custom roms. Thankfully, there are a lot of online forums and ROM options. The hard part is getting started but I guarantee that you won't regret it.I am currently using the latest AEX ROM with Nougat 7.1.2# Stable ROM# Clean, stock experience# Tons of customization options# Amazing notification features# Smooth and fast# Regular OTA updates and security patches# SOT of >6.5hrs even on 4G. System run time of >20hrs easily# Once unlocked, you can install any custom ROM within minutesI would strongly recommend anyone buying this phone to go for a custom ROM as soon as possible. I am not allowed to add direct link here but you should be able to find the following items easily.Unlocking - Check for tutorials on youtubeROM - I am using the 20.09.2017 build of AEX romGApps - Download ARM64-7.1-stock versionTips:# Take backup of WhatsApp, Expense Manager, sms etc# Follow the YouTube tutorial to unlock# Take full backup of your stock ROM and wipe clean# Install ROM (try to stick to stable/official builds) and GApps# Enjoy the full potential of this deviceHope this helps.

( ********No earphones included ****)*PROS*1) Absolute lag-less experience. No issues with performance at all. Fluidic switching between apps (even games).2) Amazing fingerprint scanner (To be very frank, I've tested OnePlus3 too, and I found Z2 Plus is faster. Gets faster as you keep using it).3) Sound output through 3.5mm jack is just crystal clear. For an Audiophile like me, Treble output was decent, Bass was amazing. The Speaker was decent enough; easily heard in outside crowd conditions (Although I rarely use the speakers).4) UHealth app works fairly accurately, Pedometer sensor is pretty good.5) U-Touch option is one of its kind (Best feature)6) The 4G speeds on this is just amazing. (Apparently, I found that its always active on the 4G bandwidth so whenever I switch on data it displays all the messages instantly).7) The charging rate is pretty fast too, takes around 2hr 15mins on an average to charge.8) 5inch form-factor is wonderful, and just what I wanted.9) Looks like an iPhone Jet Black series due to the backside glass.10) Double Tap to wake is an awesome feature.*CONS*1) No arguments, as other reviewers have stated too; the camera falls off in low lit conditions. Does a decent job in outside daylight. (Both front and rear).2) I found that Google Keyboard (Gboard) is making the device lag while typing on keyboard ( Yes, I almost fainted ). But it's probably due to the new update and the lag only appears very RARELY and that too doesn't affect other device performances (switching and using other apps). Only happens in the gboard while typing.3) The notification light was one huge backdrop for me personally since it's only a single white light LED on top right, which is usually not visible at certain angles but is very bright when viewed face front and around. Although you can change whether the light blinks or stays constantly lit.*My Personal Opinion*There were many critical reviews about the heating issue this device has, but I found nothing which is out of the ordinary. Playing heavy games, yes sure the heating is kind of accentuated by the black body of the device, although is not a huge issue since it's particularly present in almost all the devices of this era. I'm using it for a college lifestyle; using it for sometime in direct bright sunlight causes it to heat up a bit which is very normal.I guess some of the devices which are present are faulty or maybe just due to consumer based usage.In the end, clearly the PROS outweigh the CONS by a huge margin.Definitely the best Smartphone device in under 20K range.Snapdragon 820, Adreno 530, 441ppi screen display.

Perfect size for a phone. Feels solid and comfortable in hand. Comes along with the wonderful case.2. 820 SD- without any doubt best buy at this price3.

Everything works perfectly in my experience.I purchased mainly for Jio VoLTE calling as my Zenfone 2 didn't support native 4G calling, and was draining it's battery by noon. Since it is not practical to keep running back to charge, I needed a VoLTE phone which could last the whole day.I got the 4Gb/64GB version for 14999, and have to say I am impressed. I was travelling on train, and waking up at 3 am, I noticed the Amazon app screen on my phone had updated information, the price was reduced to 14999. So I ordered immediately and got it within 24 hours of reaching my destination or exactly 34 hours after placing the order. Which is awesome!I updated to ZUI 2.0.133 which was a 280+ MB download. The phone is very snappy, and doesn't heat up during normal usage (I don't bother with games), so I am guessing that a lot of people who complain here load all sorts of incompatible programs and overheat the device - it is a very capable arm64 processor crammed into a very compact space so it is possible to create an overheating situation rather easily.Great buy, will recommend  for anyone who wants a smartphone. No, it is not suitable for movies or music, not after using big screen Samsung Notes mostly but for communicating this is just perfect. The battery lasts the entire day of 4G, so I don't feel so constrained about using it unlike the Zenfone.

Looks better with the supplied phone cover than being naked. Take a backup of os after root. Shame that gsmarena haven't done a proper review on this gem of a phone. Adjusting the exposure actually lowers the iso, so results were much better. Problem with the default cam is that it adjust it self after taking each pic.Led Colour Indicator would have been better. No dual 4g as LG g5. Sdcard would have been great. App start time is better than pixel . Leave out benchmarks, in real world Z2 is the king.

OOTB Android 6.0.1 - Upgradable to Nougat which takes the experience with this device to another level.5. Unibody Premium Design with back panel of glass. Although it's fingerprint magnet, you get a case OOTB which I would recommend you put on always.6. U-Touch: This is something that you will admire a lot. The Physical Home Button that you can customise to do multiple functions like:a. Extremely responsive fingerprint scannerb. Switch between Apps - This is awesome.c. Other functions for 'Double Touch', 'Long Press', 'Long Touch' as per your desire.The Cameras:Both front and rear, are not as great as you would find in other devices.

It is also very fast in performing operations like connecting to WiFi, you tap and if network is saved, it connects - very fast. Finger print scanner is very fast even though I have registered multiple fingers, it detects and unlocks in no time.When it comes to camera, I heard lot many reviews that it is ok type camera, but I disagree. I have a Samsung OnNxt, I have Nexus 5X with my relatives, but so far I found its camera as the best. And with the ample amount of photo editing apps (snapseed by Google the best lightweight app, IMO), the photos can be made even better.For the 5 inch screen, let me tell you, I owned a 5.5 inches screen phone from last four years. I was bit worried in buying this phone as I felt it would feel small. But believe me, it does not feel small at all. I has a nice form factor and high pixel density, this makes the images appear very good and the it feel so good to hold it.

Been using this phone for 6 months now, got it on Aug 10, 2017.Here's some detailed info about this beast-(Android N update is available in system settings, so those people who are wondering if it can be updated, yes it can be!     Android N update also gives videocall feature.)No less than a flagship phone.Timely delivery, thanks Amazon.Great packing, the phone comes ready to use straight out of the box. Matte finish screenguard and matte rubber case, looks amazing.There's a known issue with the phone freezing with the notification LED on, screen doesn't turn on and nothing helps. Can be easily fixed by keeping the power button pressed for 5 seconds to perform a reset. Goes back to normal within 7 seconds.We cannot switch off one sim, it's either both on or both off.The screen is quiet good, a resolution of 1920*1080 with a 441ppi density makes it ultra clear. Games and movies never looked clearer. Been playing Hitman: Sniper for hours at full settings and not a single lag at any moment.The processing power is great, handles demanding games easily at full graphics settings and unbeatable at this price. Tasks like app updates/install, uninstalls, phone restarts, network switch, etc. are taken care of in a jiffy. Is ready to use within 6 seconds after a restart/reboot is performed.Heats up a little bit for obvious reasons- when the processor is at full utilization, else always remains cool. Some people keep saying that this phone heats a lot don't buy it, they should check their usage, obviously the device will heat up if you're downloading stuff over mobile data and playing demanding games while charging the device.     RAM is awesome, have all apps running at once and not a lag at all, seamless multitasking, easy switching using the U-touch button.There's no need of the on-screen navigation buttons(which can be turned off through the settings and also makes the usable area on the display bigger) as the U-touch button(fingerprint sensor) can do it all. It has 7 functions(back, home, recent, app switch, etc)!     Night color feature is a bluelight filter which really reduces the strain on eyes when working in dark environments, although there's a bug where at times the stern starts flickering if the on-screen keyboard is toggled on certain WebView elements in apps and Chrome on certain websites, but not an issue as I think it's my keyboard, doesn't happen with Google keyboard.The battery lasts for one and a half day of proper usage- intermittent WhatsApp, Facebook, Dual Sim on, Wifi<>4G on all the time, VoLTE calls atleast 2 hours,  and still there's ~15% battery after 1.5 days, totally awesome.Cell reception is way better than others.The camera is really great if you know how to use the modes, including SlowMo, TimeLapse, etc. (Gets better after updating to Nougat- manual mode added.)Front camera angle is really wide and great for selfies.The phone is very light despite of having a 3500mAh battery, not sure how Zuk pulled this off. Totally love this phone and recommend to anyone who wants a phone worth their money.P.S- A chrono case is available for this phone, for the ones who haven't got it yet, should! It just makes it so awesome.P.P.S- The pedometer works awesome, keeps a track of steps walked all the time and eliminates the need of a separate fitness tracker.

It has been almost a month now since I have started using it.The good:-The build quality is excellent. Although it's made from some reenforced fiber, it feels solid and does not flex. The rollinetal cage design gives it strength and stability.The phone also comes with a pre installed scratch guard and a protective case which is good.Camera quality is average but you won't be disappointed by it.The phone as a whole is lighting fast with its snapdragon 820 chipset with 4gb ram and 64gb internal storage which is not expandable. But I think 64gb is more than enough for an average user...so that's not a problem.Fingerprint sensor is good and unlocks accurately 9/10 times.The bad:-Although the phone is fast because of the SD820 chipset, it does have it's drawbacks.The phone heats up quickly and feels uncomfortable in the hands. During heavy gaming like playing asphalt 8, or while charging, the temperature rises above 45 degree celsius!!Apart from the heating issues, the phone drains battery very quickly specially when it is using 4g or volte (for JIO users). The 3500 mah battery barely lasted me an entire day when my 4g is switched on.Another area where I found an issue with were the speakers. The phone has a single speaker at the bottom. Hence the sound output was not as loud as I had expected it to be. I had to, for most of the time, keep the speaker volume at maximum.Also, if I am not wrong, this phone supports quick charging because of the SD820 but Lenovo does not provide the required charger for it!!The front and back of the phone is made of some glass which does not seem to be Corning gorilla glass!! I think  using Corning gorilla glass 3, at least on the front , should have been used.After all the cons I have listed above, there is a solution to improve and increase the battery life and reduce the heating issue drastically (seriously!!). INSTALL A CUSTOM ROM!!I know it voids warranty and all but I'd suggest installing a AICP custom ROM since its the most stable ROM on this phone with android N (7.1.2).This will solve all the heating and battery issue and will unleash the real power of this beast!!To be very frank, the stock ROM is horrible!!To conclude, the phone is amazing and is surely a  value for money buy only if you are willing to flash a custom ROM on it( check out videos on YouTube).

So i asked for a replacement and i got it delivered on 17th of this month. But the replaced item also had some smudge type things on the back guard of the phone. So they offered me a refund. But as i have a 10 days replacement policy i decided to use the phone to check whether it had any defects. So its been 8 days since am using this phone and everything regarding hardware and build quality of this phone is so great except the stock ROM which everyone here have mentioned. The ROM is not only providing very poor user experience, its also having some bugs i think.For eg :-1) Even when my notification volume is high i wont hear any notification sound or ringtone sound while am getting any messages or calls. But at that time when i play some songs or movies its working fine. Means my speaker doesn't have any issue. After sometime automatically i will be hearing notification tone and ringtone.2) When i try to get into Setting --> Advanced Settings --> Accounts & Sync --> Others the screen goes back to advanced settings itself. And now am not able to get into Others option.3) Almost all the apps will be working in the background and it will be taking a lot of our data and battery life. It doesn't have any proper phone management app which can handle the apps network and battery usage. Actually its not a bug. But i still wanted to mention this.And i have been facing some small lag issue after the phone get restarted which will get to normal after sometime. But in a mobile with 4GB DDR3 Ram and SD820 processor i was not even expecting this small lag.Am not sure whether there will be more bugs i the stock ROM and am confused thinking whether i should return the phone and get refunded with in two days or continue using it.Am also having heat issues.

The horizontal swipe (left to right) does not work at least 80% times and you have to keep trying to get it done.4. The camera is really slow to start and lags when trying to take multiple pictures or when focussing.5. The camera quality is bad when taking pictures in less than perfect lighting.6. The customer service seems non existent. If you contact them they mostly ask you to visit the service centre (and waste hours of your precious time).The only goods are:1. If you are a basic user who does not use your phone for much except calling, basic emailing and messaging apps like WhatsApp, it should be a very good phone for you.2. It looks good without the cover if you can take good care of it as it has glass on both sides.3.

(Especially after android 7 update)P.S.The inclusion of manual mode to the camera was a much needed boost, and it has changed the way I take photos on this phone. In short, it's awesome.(Though, I would like to mention that given the range of the phone, camera is good, but I've seen better. It struggles in the low light conditions)The biggest pro is, obviously, it's powerful flagship processor: SD 820, paired up with 4gigs of DDR4 ram.I never kill my applications, so basically, it almost have more than 20 apps running in the background. I have never seen any lags so far, and the ram management is excellent as well.Display is brilliant and Lenovo offers various Colors settings as well (which is great)And the size of the screen is optimum for single handed use. Paired with the ZUI, which is also designed keeping in mind single handed user experience, this phone serves my purpose great.I touch works flawlessly.It's a bang for the buck.One con is that I don't really like the way this phone has a flat back, which could've been a little more ergonomic.Personally I like my phone to be slightly bulky, but I guess that it just comes down to personal preference.Another problem I faced is with the fingerprint scanner. Since I sweat quite a bit, I end up getting the front mounted FP scanner dirty, and sometimes wet. This affects it's response and readability.

Paid 10.5, got 450 back as I paid thru Amazon pay balance. Out of the box, external and earpiece speaker volumes were very low - almost inaudible outdoors. Only slight heating issue for me - charging or otherwise. All these issues got fixed with the one 6.0 and one 7.0 update from Lenovo.On the initial charge, the phone charged upto 67% and then nothing came on the screen for quite some time. It did not boot for a few hours, while the phone body was got really hot during this down time. but eventually it did boot. But it has not had any issues since then. After the upgrade to 7.0, speaker and earpiece volumes are noticeably better though not the greatest. Camera is quite decent in good lighting. Battery backup is very very good.After finishing the calls, screen wont come on. The matt screenguard which came out of the box with the phone was the culprit. Once I removed it, proximity sensor worked very well.Heating is not due to SD 820 - he'll SD820 is especially designed with care by Qualcomm to wipe off the bad feedback that 810 had in terms of heating. Heating is due to the graphite battery, improper placement of sensors which don't let the heat escape and the glass(insulator) covering on the front and back.The reason I have given 4 stars with so much negatives is because, source code is made available. There are plenty of custom roms with kernels which take care of future proofing this phone. Android 8.0 Oreo ROMs are already being tested out. Even if Lenovo doesn't issue any more updates, we can be assured of software support from the dev community at XDA. This is not a mid range 600/650 series processor or a low end 400 series. This is a flagship processor, which only means that the life of the software defines the life of the hardware.

Read on why.PROS1. Performance - You're getting a 4GB/64GB variant with Snapdragon 820 SoC under the hood. Yeah the same Snapdragon 820 which the 50K Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge has. And the price you're getting it for? 12K!!! Antutu score after Nougat is over 1.3 lakh, the snappy and jazzy performance of the SoC coupled with readily accessible is jaw dropping fast - Are you even reading any further or have already placed the order?2. RAM Optimization - Some of the best RAM management I have ever seen in a phone, apps stay lit even after hours, the swipe task switcher home button only simplifies your switching mechanism and boy RAM stays peppy than ever even after you're done running few dozens of them. Truly ground breaking stuff in the era of memory leaks, wastage, idle background sipper stories of dynamic memory.3. Battery & Charging - While 3500 mAH is not much, please remember the screen is 5\" FHD one. I get around 4-6 hours of SOT every day with 1.5 days of standby. Add to that, the phone has a unique feature not advertised much. Suppose you leave your phone on charger overnight, normally the current overdraws takes a toll on cells of your battery and make it wear out faster than normal. However, this phone cuts down the power supply to battery altogether on completion of 100% charge, till you unplug it and reset the charge cycle. Another of the nifty, useful and excellent features not all mobile manufacturers think about.4. Fingerprint scanner features - Comes with great fingerprint gestures. Swiping left/right with your registered finger switches you to and forth between open apps. Long touch (not physically press) the home button opens the recent tasks menu while a single tap takes you one step back. I don't know how I have missed this feature for so long.  Fingerprint scanner itself is fast to detect and unlocks in less than 0.3 sec.CONS:1. Audio - Not bad but not good either. The output is flat, response is cold and low resonant sound that amounts to nothing. Loudness and sound quality is no match for Lenovo P2 which is by far the best sounding phone Lenovo ever produced.2. Camera - Again, a hazy camera with grainy performance under home lighting conditions. Outside it is great and vibrant but within dark, it is horrible. Not that I was expecting very much but still for the given SoC, I wished Lenovo must've used a similarly great camera sensor.3. Buggy UI - Bugs are all over this phone. Notifications, little spelling mistakes over the menus and what not. Lenovo seriously needs to consider revamping their software updater department else it is a lost game for Lenovo.In short, for 11K (which I got it) I can't even nitpick this phone out. This is the greatest 4GB/64GB combination with legendary 14nm Snapdragon 820 SoC that will ever come out.

Very poor power management.5) Camera-An average camera that struggles in indoor lighting.6) Gaming-Screen might hang or the game might exit on its own.

Obviously, a service center won't ever agree to provide such letters as it wasn't the case of DOA or DOS either (because they weren't denying the service at all).

No need to think twice, go for it. No major con/bug.  Very good handset. Decent size, high resolution screen, flagship processor, RAM & memory. Average camera, but good for the price paid. No heating or minimalheating if you are continuously on cellular data. Very good build quality. Very good back cover & screen cover provided along with handset. Very good battery life, should easily last for 1.5-2 days with moderate use.Don't go on negative reviews, just buy it.Update: After a week's use, rating is still same.Best thi gs in phone: One of fastest GPS fis (always locates correctly in less than 3 seconds).Signal reception is good.Call quality & in call volume is very good.No heating at allBattery backup is very good.Quality of camera has somehow improved, now it's just above average camera. But still not upto mark.Fingerprint reader, always unlocks in second attempt & occasionally in first attempt, that's not at all an issue for me.Sound output through speakers is decent (not very low as claimed by some).Overall happy purchase.After 2 weeks of use, rating is same 5 stars.No complains.Regarding camera quality, due to high resolution of screen & preapplied screen guard, the quality of photos appear low (blurry & grainy), but if you transfer photos to laptop or other phone, quality is acceptable (it  is unlikely to be flagship grade, which is not expected from a mid ranger phone).For better battery life  - uninstall all bloatware you are not using. Shift cellular network of second sim to 2G only (by default it's 3G preferred, which wastes battery due to low 3G connectivity in India, & there is no advantage of keeping it 3G preferred). Battery should last 1.5-2days easily depending on the usage pattern.Regarding cellular reception, it's very good,I compared to my previous phone- redmi 2, it's far better than that, with very good download speeds.For those experiencing low sensitivity/accuracy of fingerprint sensor - just uninstall superb cleaner application and see themagic. Sensitivity/accuracy should increase dramatically.Best value for money.Update after 1 month of use:Still rating same - five starVery good battery with default power saving settings - 6-7 hours SOT, with >24 hours standby time.Very good U health app to track calorie expenditure, no impact on battery at all.Fantastic GPS fix.Good in call & speaker volume.Fantastic speed and performance.No heating at all.Decent camera.Value for money....", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "25 Jul 2017,"], ["I just brought this phone Last month, still it didn't cross one month.... presently my phone is not working properly... because when calls comes I can't even here anything from other side...I need to put my mobile for loudspeaker then only I can here what opposite side person is telling.. dear all please don't prefer this phone...it doesn't Worth for your money.... pathetic experience from Lenovo..", "0 users found this review helpful", "1 stars", "25 Jul 2017,"], ["bad expereince, not good", "0 users found this review helpful", "1 stars", "25 Jul 2017,"], ["small size phoneEven though it has snapdragon820 , a flagship processor  but doesn't perform like a beastit lags sometimesits thick and bulky and with cover feels like a stone blockYeah it is sturdy . fingerprint sensor normally doesn't sense biometrics in small amount of sand .battery drops very fast and it even can't stand for 6 hours of full use.i do not recommend this phone to anyone..... finally i resold it !!", "0 users found this review helpful", "2 stars", "24 Jul 2017,"], ["I bought this phone on 15th.

Can it get any better? Yes it can. It's main competitor Coolpad Cool 1 is better than Zuk Z2 Plus according to me. I have compared Coolpad Cool 1 with Zuk Z2 Plus and at last given a final verdict whether you should buy Zuk or go with Coolpad.---] So, If you are thinking of BUYING this mobile or have SHORTLISTED it, then you must read my EXPERIENCE about Lenovo Zuk Z2 Plus. If you do not want to read the WHOLE REVIEW, simply read the DEAL MAKER, DEAL BREAKER and CONCLUSION SECTIONS and you will DEFINITELY know whether to buy this phone or not.---] One more thing that this review is written, okay typed, by ME and not copied from Internet (You can confirm it by reading the review as it does not have that 'classy-bookish English' language with long paragraphs.---] Also KUDOS from me to you, THE READER, as YOU are a SMART BUYER who is first THOROUGHLY RESEARCHING about the product and THEN THINKING whether to PURCHASE it or not. CHEERS!______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________A) DEAL MAKER ::a) 13MP PRIMARY and SECONDARY Camerasb) 4K Video Recordingc) Fast Chargingd) 4 GB DDR4 RAMe) Gorilla Glass 3 Protection_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________B) DEAL BREAKER ::a) No expandable storage which might be a Deal Breaker for some as many of the users have their data in their memory cards of previous phones and transferring all that data requires quite a bit of time.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________C) CONCLUSION ::---] In MY OPINION, after thorough usage and testing, I THINK you should go with Coolpad Cool 1 and NOT with Zuk Z2 Plus. Coolpad Cool 1 is till date, the BEST SMARTPHONE you can buy under Rs.15000 as it is a complete package with a very good processor too.---] BUT, if you are more concern of the Lenovo's Branding and just want a Snapdragon 820 processor and accept the fact that it has a 5 inch screen, then you can buy Zuk Z2 Plus.---] In terms of AFTER SALES SERVICE, Samsung, Apple, One-Plus,etc., are the best and you will not face any issue from their side.FINAL RATING :: 8.8/10---] It REALLY FEELS GOOD to know if someone gets help from my review and hard work in writing review feels justified.(FULL REVIEW WITH POINT WISE RATING BELOW)______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________A) FEATURES WHICH MATTERS AND NOT JUST SPECS SHEET ::(i) CAMERA----] This mobile has a 8 Mega Pixel front facing camera WITHOUT LED FLASH. The front facing camera is EXCELLENT and you will not have any complaint in future regarding it.---] The primary camera is a 13 Mega Pixel shooter with PDAF and Professional Mode. Also, it can shoot videos at 4K resolution which is just excellent in this price segment though you can get DUAL CAMERA 4K recording with Coolpad Cool 1 but it's processor is not that great as the Zuk Z2 Plus has. Though, Cool 1 offers a DUAL CAMERAS with also 4K shooting capabilities.CAMERA RATING ::PRIMARY CAMERA : 9/10SECONDARY/SELFIE CAMERA: 8.6/10______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________(ii) SCREEN----] This headset comes with a 5 inch FULL HD LCD display with 441 pixels per inch which is MORE THAN SUFFICIENT for GAMING AND DAILY USAGE and the screen DOES NOT feel PIXELATED or LESS CRISPY at all.---] If you are into VIRTUAL REALITY, you will have an GOOD EXPERIENCE as due to the small size, the pixel density is GREAT and so the quality of the VR magnifying is also great. It comes with a GORILLA GLASS 3 PROTECTION so your screen is always safe.---] You should thoroughly consider whether you are satisfied with a 5 inch screen or not. If not, I recommend you buy Coolpad Cool 1 and not Zuk Z2 Plus.SCREEN RATING :: 9.5/10______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________(iii) DESIGNING OF SOFTWARE AND PHONE----] I personally do not like the plane design of the Zuk Z2 Plus. In terms of design, Lenovo is not that great as can be seen from the designs of Moto series smartphones but Cool 1 design is very good and appealing than that of Zuk's.---] Also, I do not like the stock Android experience but that too you can change and customize by installing various themes from Google Play Store.DESIGN RATING ::LOOKS/APPEARANCE : 7.8/10SOFTWARE : 8/10______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________(iv) BATTERY, SPEAKERS AND PERFORMANCE----] This headset comes with a 3500 mAH BATTERY which can easily last 1 DAY if you are a HEAVY USER and Net Surfer. For NORMAL users like me, it lasts for an average of 2 DAYS EASILY with 10% Battery STILL LEFT! With FAST CHARGING SUPPORT, battery is not a problem anymore!---] It comes with a USB Type-C PORT which is NOT A PROBLEM BUT AN ADVANTAGE as the FUTURE OF CHARGING GADGETS IS USB Type-C! Come On!---] The SPEAKERS are NOT that great in bass but are CLEAR and LOUD. It has 3.5 mm JACK too so DO NOT feel your OLD WIRED EARPHONES are of no use now. EARPHONES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE BOX.---] PERFORMANCE WISE, the phone NEVER HANGED OR LAGGED in my DAILY USAGE and HARDCORE MULTI TASKING and switching between HEAVY GAMES and APPS was just a PIECE OF CAKE for the processor! I ASSURE you that performance will not be a problem in future as the combination of CPU(Snapdragon 820) and RAM(4 GB DDR4) is more than enough to handle all that extra pressure.---] It also has a VERY FAST Finger Print Unlocking. You CANNOT INSERT A microSD card to expand the storage of this smartphone but it comes with 64GB internal storage which is sufficient for 99% of the users.BATTERY RATING :: 9/10SPEAKER RATING :: 7/10PERFORMANCE RATING :: 10/10______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________(v) UNIQUENESS----] This mobile has the top Snapdragon 820 processor with DDR4 4GB RAM and 4K recording at Rs.14999. This is itself a VERY UNIQUE deal!UNIQUENESS RATING :: 9/10______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________---] It REALLY FEELS GOOD to know if someone gets help from my review and hard work in writing review feels justified.---] Thank You for reading the review.

I AM NOT A FANBOY.2. WHEN I CONSIDER BUYING ANY PHONE, I CONSIDER THREE THINGS : MY REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTATIONS, THE PRICE OF THE UNIT UNDER CONSIDERATION AND THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE OFFERED BY THE UNIT.3. EVERYONE WANTS THE BEST IN THE MARKET, SO DID I, BUT I HAD TO CONSIDER MY BUDGET ALSO - UPTO 15K.4. I COMPARED THE SPECIFICATIONS OF ALL UNITS OF ALL BRANDS UNDER 15K, BUT DID NOT SETTLE FOR ANY. SOMEONE WAS OFFERING SNAPDRAGON 625, SOMEONE ELSE WAS OFFERING 4 GB RAM, AND SO ON , BUT NONE OF THEM HAD EVERYTHING IN ONE UNIT.5. FINALLY I CAME ACROSS THIS PHONE AND THE FIRST THING THAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION WAS THAT IT HAS SNAPDRAGON 820. AS WE ALL KNOW, THESE ARE SoCs, i.e. EVERYTHING IS FABBED ON THE BOARD WHICH CANNOT BE ALTERED AFTER IT LEAVES THE FAB. HENCE UNLIKE DESKTOP PC MARKET WHERE YOU CAN CUSTOM BUILD A PC WITH AN i7 AND 4gB OR 16 GB RAM, MOBILE CHIPSETS CANNOT BE RECONFIGURED AT THE H/W LEVEL, SO WHEN THEY SAY SNAPDRAGON 820, IT IS SNAPDRAGON 820(USE INTERNET TO GET DETAILED SPECIFICATIONS OF SNAPDRAGON 820). PERIOD.6. I CONSIDER SD 820 TO STILL BE ONE-OF-THE-CUTTING-EDGE SoCs, BECAUSE, ALTHOUGH IT WAS LAUNCHED IN LATE 2015, SD 821 OFFERS NO ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS, ONLY PROCESS SHRINK AND A MERE 10% PERFORMANCE GAIN. PHONES SPORTING SD 820 ARE PRICED ABOVE 27K, WHICH I PERSONALLY FIND UNWORTHY AS THE PERFORMANCE GAIN IS SIMPLY 10%. MORE 12k FOR 10% GAIN, NO WAY.7. SECOND RESON TO STILL CONSIDER SD 820 AS CUTTING EDGE IS SD 835. YES, SNAPDRAGON 835. IF YOU DO THE MATH SD 835 OFFERS UPTO 135% PERFORMANCE AS COMPARED TO SD 820. YES, I KNOW 35% PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT IS GOOD. BUT AGAIN, CONSIDER THE PRICE OF PHONES SPORTING SD 835 - AROUND AND ABOVE 60K. PREMIUM OF 45K. AGAIN NOT WORTH IT.8. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PHONE FOR A MONTH NOW. LET ME TELL YOU :  -  THE RESPONSE, SPEED AND PERFORMANCE OF THIS PHONE IS JUST OUT-OF-THE-WORLD. THANKS TO SD 820.  -  BRILLIANT DISPLAY AND PIXEL DENSITY AT THIS POINT.  -  VERY GOOD BATTERY LIFE, EASILY LASTS A DAY UNDER HEAVY USAGE - 3500mAh.  -  GPU : ADRENO 530. PERIOD. NEED I SAY MORE ?  -  3 GB OF DDR 4 RAM. D-D-R-4.  -  ON CHIP ACCELERATION FOR 4K H.264 AND HEVC PLAYBACK, AT THIS PRICE POINT.  -  AVERAGE BUT LOUD SPEAKERS.  -  YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME, BUT, VERY GOOD CAMERA AT THIS PRICE POINT.  -  USB TYPE C CONNECTOR. YES, YOU READ IT RIGHT, U-S-B-T-Y-P-E-C. WHICH PHONE AT THIS PRICE POINT HAS THIS ?  -  ANDROID 7.0.0 UPDATE ALREADY RELEASED.  -  PHONE FEELS PREMIUM IN HANDS - COMPLETES THE PREMIUM EXPERIENCE OF THE PHONE.  -  PHONE GETS A LITTLE BIT WARM UNDER HEAVY LOAD. READ AGAIN - A LITTLE BIT. I THINK ITS OK CONSIDERING THE SD 820.MY ADVICE TO YOU ALL IS, STOP WAITING FOR \" THE WANNABE OVERPRICED FRUIT PHONES\", JUST BY THIS BEFORE IT GETS OUT OF STOCK.YOU CAN USE YOUR OWN BRAIN TO COMPARE CHIP LEVEL DIFFERENCES OF SD 820 WITH OTHERS ( WHILE KEEPING IN MIND THE PRICE OF THIS PHONE - 15K ).I HOPE AFTER READING THIS THE BUYER WILL BE MUCH MORE AWARE WHILE CHOOSING A PHONE.", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "17 Jul 2017,"], ["Good Phone and awesome Delivery...but sad didnot get any discount! so rated 4 *", "0 users found this review helpful", "4 stars", "17 Jul 2017,"], ["Good Phone, battery backup could have been better and feel some further updates required on the main OS, eg. doesn't show no. of unread sms'sdoesn't reflect no. of missed calls on the phone icon. which are very basic and must be there in any phone.", "0 users found this review helpful", "4 stars", "17 Jul 2017,"], ["Fingerprint use & Too much heating problem and phone is not valuable at this cost & one more is Amazon worst rules there is  no return option directly.", "0 users found this review helpful", "1 stars", "17 Jul 2017,"], ["very worst phone. it starts heating when we turn on the internet and start surfing.

SD 820 clocking 2.15 GHZ coupled with 4 Gig RAM, the operation is butter smooth and smashing. I had as well seen some poor review on the camera and all I understand is that people are immediately seeing the output of the camera on the screen with matte finish screen guard which is not 100% transparent. This for sure will add noise to the image captured. If they had taken time to see through google photos in the desktop, they would have realized the true quality. I was surprised with the fingerprint sensor as it is blazing fast.Coming to Amazon service:I too initially received the phone which was unable to perform system update (while all the other functionalities were working brilliantly) and tried all the aspects recommended in various forums which did not yield any good result, I decided to raise a complaint to Amazon CS. They took note of the complaint, sent a technician to validate the performance of the phone and accepting my claim, the technician advised for a replacement and as well told the next steps of activity.I called back Amazon CS to update the outcome of the inspection and immediately the replacement was ordered and the new phone was delivered before the committed time. This time, I upgraded from MM to Nougat without any glitch and am now enjoying...Having paid the price of peanut, I feel I have received a product which is quadruple times its actual worth from a wonderful e-tailer..And absolutely no regrets..Great Job Amazon and Lenovo, and Way to Go!!", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "11 Jul 2017,"], ["Update after about a month of usage:Despite all the fuss about the  \"snapdragon 820\" that this phone flaunts, you cannot expect flagship level performance on this device, at least not with the stock ROM. It lags, yes you heard me right. It stutters and lags a bit within a few days. All android phones do that, even the s8, I've heard. The battery performance drops after a few days and despite the smaller screen size, the 3500 mAh battery fails to give a satisfying screen on time. If battery is important to you then ditch this guy right now and go for the redmi note 4. The charger supplied looks cheap and you may be better off getting a better quality charger and cable. There are heating episodes that come and go; I don't know what is causing them but when the phone overheats it refuses to charge. The glass back is a useless feature because it lacks the structural strength of the iPhone 4s it tries to mimic and is therefore useless without the back cover. The back cover is a good one but you are better off getting a hybrid armored case because if you drop the phone, the cover won't be able to protect the screen.I've been told that flashing a custom ROM is a good idea but I'm worried that will void the warranty and even if it won't, I'm not comfortable with fooling around with operating systems. My experience with various linux distros on PC has taught me something: integrity matters. Despite all the praise one hears from the linux fanboys, ubuntu and others like it just aren't up to the mark compared to windows or OS X  in terms of performance and user experience. I think the same may apply to these fancy custom ROMs I keep hearing about. I also hear about the bugs and embarrassing stuff like \"my hotspot isn't working\" or \"my wifi just won't turn off\" etc from people using these custom ROMs.No thanks, I will stick with the stock ROM because it must be the most optimized OS for this device. Plus there isn't any bundled bloatware on the device, discounting google apps like playmovies (which is useless acc to me) and others like which are actually good. PlayMusic for instance is a good app for playing songs. The default file explorer is simple and gets the job done. The camera app is also intuitive and simple to use. The inbuilt health app, U Health is also good but if you're serious about your jogging/cycling you may want a more professional app like strava.The display is very sharp, bright and satisfying. The brightness sensor though is a bit slow. The camera is comparable to iPhone 5s's camera if used properly in daylight. It is next to useless in low light conditions. Close shots in \"no light\" conditions however are better than  the iPhone 6s camera! This one was a surprise. I don't think there's OIS and videos are shaky if you're not still while shooting. The auto focus feature is very very slow, like about twice the time that iPhone 5s camera takes. The shutter speed is okay but nowhere near as good as iPhone 5s or 6s. The HDR feature is an embarrassment and is useless.The fingerprint sensor is alright but won't work unless your finger is clean.Sound quality via the headphone jack is alright. The loudspeaker is useless. If you're someone that likes to play music or videos on speakers, just ditch the idea of buying this phone right now and go for redmi note 4 which I hear has dual speakers.The ZUI is a work in progress and I applaud Lenovo for trying to mimic iOS with such fervor but the typical android user does not appreciate these kind of changes. Personally, I actually like the ZUI because I am an iOS fan. That said, the ZUI does need a lot of tweaking. The U touch feature is awesome and you may want to disable onscreen buttons entirely. It does take a few days to get the hang of it but it is worth it.The default google now launcher is an embarrassment according to me. It looks awful. It may be a personal thing but I suggest a more visually appealing launcher like Yandex Zen or Microsoft Launcher (both of which are also works in progress but are less of an embarrassment and very intuitive).All in all, if you're after the sd820 which happens to be the selling feature of this device, and don't care much about battery life or speakers and wouldn't mind flashing custom ROMs and all those tweaky business that android OS entails, go for it. Avoid if you want an out of the box experience: in that case the redmi note 4 is a better choice. Avoid if you want a phone that lasts more than a day, the battery is average despite the big number of mAh. Avoid if camera is very important to you; check out the lenovo vibe shot. Avoid also if you're a selfie lover; save up and go for those overpriced brainless oppo/vivo phones (moon me se nikal ke aayegi selfie).-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Customary (also cordial) remarks on Android vs iOS coming from an iOS fan:Android users have to accept that consistent high level performance is mostly about optimization and integrity of hardware and software, not raw power. That is a crude, donkeyish approach which seems to be glorified in the android world. There is a reason why the last year's iPhones always smoke the latest android phones in terms of performance and consistency. I have come to accept the glaringly obvious truth that android phones sell so much simply because they are cheaper than iPhones. If apple priced their products more reasonably (from the customers' perspective) they would beat all android phones in sales within a few years. All the fuss about \"features\" and \"customization\" are just gimmicks. Features and customization don't always add up to a good user experience. Integrity and optimization is very important. Most people just don't have the time or the interest in fooling around with launchers and custom ROMs. If they could get a reasonably priced phone which works flawlessly over the years they would not care about the \"features\" as much. Lower price is the main selling point of Android phones. Another area where iOS smokes Android is memory management. When it comes to multi tasking and RAM management, iOS is the beast. Android on the other hand is an aptly named \"garbage collector\" (no I didn't make that up, its a computer term). I'm including this last para for the benefit of the android users who are frustrated with the constant lags and hangs of android OS and take for granted that iOS is for children. Look past the hate, people. TRY iOS once and see for yourself how smooth it is. I don't think it is without it's flaws (the restricted ecosystem and the lack of some much needed features, stupid designs) but it does deliver the smoothness and consistency in user experience that android phones often lack.", "0 users found this review helpful", "3 stars", "11 Jul 2017,"], ["Nice phone", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "11 Jul 2017,"], ["Vaulty call problem in my mob", "0 users found this review helpful", "1 stars", "11 Jul 2017,"], ["If you are a gamer then this mobile is just made for you.

The phone booted up quickly and after a couple of initial settings such as language, I came to a halt with the Internet connection. It did NOT allow me to skip it.

I then plugged in the charger and let it charge for about 5 hours.The full-HD screen looks really good, especially with the provided matte screen guard.

A phone is supposed to fit comfortably in both your palms and pockets, while offering enough screen real estate, at which this one does a decent job. It also feels solid unlike the other thin & flimsy offerings. The matte black case provided in the box offers the best protection for the glass back without adding much bulk. In addition to that it provides a classy minimalistic, & sophisticated block look, quite reminiscent of the iPhone 5s Space Grey. Owing to the 2.5D curved glass it would be quite tough to find a tempered glass screen guard that fits properly, and hence it is better to opt for the regular thin film screen protector.Functionality & UI:ZUI is almost stock, and uses a slightly customised Google Now launcher. The major difference is that the quick tools are not accesssed from pulling down the notifications shade. Instead, it is available by pulling it up from the bottom of the screen just like in iOS, which might take some time to get used to, but is quite convenient. There is absolutely no bloatware, however you can't uninstall or disable the factory default useless Google apps like Play Movies. There is also an inbuilt night mode which decreases blue light, thereby reducing eyestrain while reading.The USP of ZUI is the U-Touch & U Health. The front mounted fingerprint sensor doubles up as the home button and there are no capacitive soft touch navigation keys.The U-Touch feature enables to carry out all the navigation tasks using the home button via multiple customisable functions such as touch, long touch, press, double press, and left & right swipe. This was the most amazing and a pretty damn cool feature that I have ever witnessed in any smartphone, which obviates the purpose of onscreen buttons, and helps you navigate your phone like a boss. The U Health app does a pretty good job at tracking your physical activity using the inbuilt fitness tracker without requiring any additional wearble devices such as bands and anything as such, and thus you could save some additional bucks.Unfortunately the default launcher can't be replaced with a custom launcher without requiring root access, since the U-Touch & U Health is built into ZUI. For this reason it is better to stick with the default functionl UI instead of a fancy custom launcher.

I ain't much of a smartphone \"gamer\", but I tried playing some pretty intensive games and this phone hasn't yet shown any signs of lag or \"overheating\". The battery performance is simply outstanding, with the phone pulling through an entire day with normal browsing , listening to music, and a little gaming. This phone also achieves an impressive feat of managing more than 8hrs of continuous screen on time while browsing using mobile data. Both the primary and secondary camera offer some great snaps and clips, even in low light. The 960fps claim is a gimmick wherein the actual recording is done in 120 fps and is slowed down 8 times digitally. It is like the equivalent of a digital zoom an analogous to video capture, wherein you don't actually zoom into the object by optical means thus sacrificing sharpness and quality.

A phone is supposed to fit comfortably in both your palms and pockets, while offering enough screen real estate, at which this one does a decent job. It also feels solid unlike the other thin & flimsy offerings. The matte black case provided in the box offers the best protection for the glass back without adding much bulk. In addition to that it provides a classy minimalistic, & sophisticated block look, quite reminiscent of the iPhone 5s Space Grey. Owing to the 2.5D curved glass it would be quite tough to find a tempered glass screen guard that fits properly, and hence it is better to opt for the regular thin film screen protector.Functionality & UI:ZUI is almost stock, and uses a slightly customised Google Now launcher. The major difference is that the quick tools are not accesssed from pulling down the notifications shade. Instead, it is available by pulling it up from the bottom of the screen just like in iOS, which might take some time to get used to, but is quite convenient. There is absolutely no bloatware, however you can't uninstall or disable the factory default useless Google apps like Play Movies. There is also an inbuilt night mode which decreases blue light, thereby reducing eyestrain while reading.The USP of ZUI is the U-Touch & U Health.

Who'd miss such a deal! I  was in need of a new phone asap. I was thinking to buy this device but then I saw a lot of negative reviews. Still I went with the this and I am really happy that I made the right choice. For a normal user the phone might have issues like heating or frequent random reboots but once you update it the official nougat version most of the problems will be solved. I have to say that the default ZUI is really useless and it feels like a fake iOS device. If you are a normal user then you should avoid this. However I'm an advanced user and flashed a custom ROM and then OMG! Everything was just buttery smooth! It was pure Android experience.The camera performs well in  good lighting conditions(see images). Another cool thing is that this phone just takes around 1.04 hours to charge with the default charger. (And yeah, USB-C all things!).Taking about the cons, I'll start with the heating issue. The phone heats moderately while charging and gaming. It's not that noticable with the case but well noticable without it. Never use the default Screen protector that comes applied with the phone. It degrades the quality of the screen. And even small scratches removes the matte coating from it. ZUI is a disaster! Utouch is the only useful thing I could find. The fingerprint scanner is very quick if and only if your scanner and your finger is clean enough. Otherwise it doesn't detect your fingerprint.Overall this is the best phone you can get at this price range! This phone was ranked 30 among best performing smartphones by Antutu Benchmark, well above all the  other similarly priced devices such as Redmi note 4 and Honor 6x. ZUK has an active developer community as well so finding custom roms won't be difficult!

I bought this phone a month ago and after using for 3 weeks I realized that my decision was not bad. I was going to buy OnePlus 5 but ran out of budget and savings may get lost for that so i began my research and i found this phone first i thought its a Mediocre phone but still I wanted a phone and my old phone's screen was broken and that company didn't have parts for it. So I bought it on 12 month EMI and when i recieved i saw that the phone is really SHINY, you won't get a headset with it but you'll get a Matte finish screenguard and a really thin BLACK back cover. The changer quality is really good you get Quick charge 3.0 and gets charge of about 97% in 1 hour and battery drainage is also very well. A FULLY CHARGED BATTERY WORKS FROM MORNING 7AM TO EVENING 6PM. It has Google Now Launcher as ROM and have some really nice in-built apps. Though no phone is perfect you'll get some issues like you won't get Gallery, Music, Radio, etc Apps in it. But you get U-Touch which is really good. I removed my on-screen navigation buttons and using one button as 6-7 shortcuts. The experience is really good but if you like customizing your phone this won't work well with this phone, after installing lots of apps and filling some movies I decided to install a Launcher but after using for a while i noticed that phone gets a little laggy.

Fingerprint sensor is very responsive.These are the cons: (I did recommended to my friends and all are facing the similar issues).1. Very bad performance - once you install more than 8 to 10 applications, you will see the lags in  opening and closing the apps.2. It say Android V7 but no option for adding other users.3. If you are planning to open google docs or google sheet never buy this phone - It wont open (you will have to download this to pdf / xls and read)4. navigation of applications by swiping the U-touch button sucks. (Its reopening the apps with the history)5. Never think about customizing quick setting bar.6. Basic stuffs like torch, settings, quick setting bar  etc are very complicated.7. NO SCREEN GUARDS / TEMPERED GLASS AVAILABLE ON MARKET - It is gorilla glass scratch resistant. But this will break and due to the slight curves on the sides on the screen NO SCREEN GUARDS / TEMPERED GLASS will fit to this.8. Banking apps take more time than other phones.9. LESS volume on speakers.10. Application performance are also decreasing day by day.11. You get only 2 sound settings on Volume buttons a) phone ring / alerts volume. b) media volume. NO MORE CUSTOMIZATION here too. If you want to adjust the volumes of Alarm, system etc you have to go to setting - >volumes (No shortcuts here.You can't un-link Phone-volume + Notification Volume.12.

It is now June 2017, and I am quite unhappy with this phone, especially because of what I got for the price I paid.This phone works like a flagship device in the first two months of purchase. The interface and specs work to its expectation when the device is new.But the slightest bit of wear on the phone, and it's true colors start coming out.- The curved edges of the embossed screen cause a major physical weakness. The tempered glass does not protect these edges, as a result the screen crack at first contact with the ground.- The back panel (which is supposedly inaccessible) is neither secured with screws nor with a latch. IT IS STUCK WITH GLUE!!! Glue, which wears off after 6 months of having the phone, exposing the innards of the phone and making it vulnerable to dust, water and all sorts of environmental damage.- At factory setting, the phone runs great. But running with downloaded and installed apps for a long time, several in-built processes (including the process for the rear camera app) begin to crash. This is one problem I have faced in low-end phones like Yureka and Mote E, but I did not expect to see it in a phone sold as a 'Flagship' device.Conclusion: You want a flagship phone with a Snapdragon 821, you'll have to spend a little. Get a One Plus 3T or something. If your budget restricts you to under 20k, so for a SD 625 or 650 chipset. Do not go for this phone. It's build quality is not upto the mark for a FLAGSHIP device.", "0 users found this review helpful", "2 stars", "06 Jul 2017,"], ["Perfect value for money and very fast processing 820", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "06 Jul 2017,"], ["Unfortunately, hard luck", "0 users found this review helpful", "2 stars", "06 Jul 2017,"], ["We don't like the product why the hell there is no returns", "0 users found this review helpful", "1 stars", "06 Jul 2017,"], ["Pros:> Value for money> Case & Matt finish screen included, which is already put on when you open the box.> Battery life is excellent.Cons:> Camera could have been better> Could have include additional \"Matt finish screen gaurds\" or should be available on amazon.> Phone overheating, but can be managed.", "0 users found this review helpful", "4 stars", "06 Jul 2017,"], ["Pros: 5 inch phone fits in hand perfectly.

The motherboard got fried .well it was due to my carelessness .Now this phone was just bought on a whim.AND WAS BOUGHT AT THE GREAT INDIAN SMARTPHONE SALE.so the price was drop drastically and it came to 11k and just like that I bought it.So this review will be based on that priceLet's talk about the build quality.GREAT OR SUPERB under 11k this has a great build quality full  glass back looks gorgeous especially the black colour making it much more premium than its price.Let's talk about its cameraWell it's just good OK. Don't just expect something like an image from OPPO F3 PLUS OR VIVO V5S . Those phones are especially made for camera nothing else. But the front camera is good . The rear camera also support SLOW MO and TIME LAPSE. But no ULTRA HD that was sad.Now going to SOFTWAREThe device runs in special UI call ZUI . A heavily skinned UI to be specific and i found it pretty good and very bad at the same time.Lets just say u will have a head time getting accustomed to it if your previous phone weren't an oppo out vivo the notification bar is useless and the quick settings panel is at the bottom.And the launcher is not good u can't customize it. Same goes for lock screenPerformanceI would say it would kill every other phone in this segment .BatteryIt last barely a day till I sleep.IT DOES NOT COME WITH QUICK CHARGE 3.0.SO DON'T BUY IT EXPECTING ONE. They have not provided a quick charge compatible charger.USE ONLY THE PROVIDED CHARGER DON'T WATER UR MONEY BUYING A QUICK CHARGER AND DESTROYING UR USB PORT.overall this is a bang for the buck this if not under 11k and don't buy it if it's more than that.GO FOR OTHER OPTIONS IF U WISH official SOFTWARE UPDATES (IT HAS NOUGAT UPDATE) AS THE COMPANY ZUK IS GOING TO SHUTDOWN BY LENOVO .", "0 users found this review helpful", "4 stars", "06 Jul 2017,"], ["Very Good phone and performance.

Only problem is that I am unable to get any proper flip cover and hardened glass. I ordered a few online from  but they were not satisfactory. 100% satisfied woth the phone, though.This review is after 1 week of purchase.Luckily I got a peice free from restarts and hanging issues. There was some heating initially but after the Security Patch and Nougat update, it is minimal now.Some of the peices may have manufacturing defects but hard resetting a few times after disabling all kinds of sync and automatic Google updates seem to solve most of the problems. I would suggest repeated factory resetting to all users.The camera is a very wide view one  and causes some perspective distortions inherent to such lenses. Initially I was frustrated and tried twice to return it. But the solution came to me suddenly. A bit of zooming in cuts the distortions immediately and make the EIS kick in. EIS is disabled in full wide mode (zoom out). Now the camera seems too good. Colours are natural and pleasing. But Low light is still a problem. Shutter is fast. I am posting some pics taken from a jumpy moving vehicle.I have really started loving the Matt screen and plan to keep it even after installing hardened glass cover. It looks much better than the shiny plasticky screens earlier.Speed and performance are blazingly fast. I have to be very careful while touching the screen, lest I touch a wrong choice! Response is lightning fast. Never seen a faster device! I have installed Nova launcher and selected high performance mode. Seems much better than Google Now launcher. Arrow launcher is also good.No FM radio. Audio is good on earphones.Speaker is quite loud, but good only for taking calls.My only grouse is that after a few day of my purchase the same phone was available for Rs10999/ on the same website.

I would like to put some light on the pros and cons of the phone for the other buyers. I will go point to point for easy understanding.Pros1. The battery is more than what it offers on the paper. With a snapdragon 825 processor and DDR4 ram the phone offers a way to good battery backup with jio or other sim 4g usage. It easily lasts a whole day with my Hotspot on data on location on whole day and video and voice calls throughout the day.2. The snapdragon 820 processor is an amazing thing about this phone. The best example of the processing speed can be seen while installing apps, usually Android phones take a lot of time in installing apps but it takes a few seconds to install good heavy apps and the light apps are mere blink of an eye. About the games... well the usual heavy ones go undoubtedly well but what impressed me was that it ran godfire which is a snapdragon 805/810 sponsored game very well without any lagging or any interruption.3. The last pros but not the least is the expensive and brilliant look that lenovo has given to the phone. The look makes it seem more expensive than it really is. The jet balck colour is the one i would recommend.Cons1. The biggest drawback of the phone is the sensors of the rear camera due to which the quality is not really good in low light and is too grainy and blur. But the camera does a good job in good light it provides very bright coloured pictures. The front camera is not something to talk about coz it performs well in low as well as good lighting conditions but yes it's also a little grainy. People looking for good camera along with above average performance can opt for redmi note 4 but again it's just above average in performance and no match to this snapdragon 825 chipset.2. Not many cons about the phone but one i think lenovo should have looked at was that being a more of a performance and techno savvy phone it should have had full customization features instead of the orthodox business class stock launcher which offers zero customization, but as we have seen the nougat update is bringing a lot of customization features to the phone as already done in china so this is not much to worry about yet.So this was my review about lenovo z2 plus. I would say people who are looking for a performance phone with good battery with average camera quality can go with this without a doubt.

It was a replacement for the excellent LG Nexus 5, I got in mid 2014. i liked the form factor and lightweight of the Nexus 5 as well as its performance and hence the choice of Z2 now.  In terms of size shape and weight it is very similar and handy. in terms of performance, the latest Snapdragon processor's speed can be really felt - it is great. I greatly appreciate the user interface which Lenovo has kept it very close to the original Android's  - simple and straight and made my transition easy.  The camera is good  enough for me and compares well if not better than the nexus 5 despite some negative reviews. The battery performance is excellent -- for my limited use, I get more than a days use on one charge and the charging speed is good enough for modest users like me with the charger supplied.  The screen clarity and intensity is excellent -- though the automatic intensity control hardly works  -- keeps reverting to minimum intensity; and does not go up when outdoor.  I like the built in app for counting my steps -- helps me track my walking needs nicely.  The GPS is good and tracked very well  when I recently visited  Bangalore -- better than the Nexus 5 version and doesn't seem to hog power.  The most positive outcome for me is that the basic phone performance ---  better than Nexus 5 -- after a flight landing,Nexus 5 would not sync / register into the network quickly and had to manually done --  Lenovo Z2 registers quickly within a mixture or two.  The voice clarity is much better with the ambient noise suppression built it -- nice feature.The ONE negative point that I is clearly noticeable is the phone is much warmer in the pocket and or when it is charging or working hard compared to my Nexus 5 -- a bit disconcerting when you feel the warmth in your pant pocket particularly on warm days here in Chennai.  It is not getting too hot to worry about - but the warmth is noticeable. It might have done better with a metal case and better heat dissipation cover.The phone came with a Matt finish screen protector already fixed to the screen and a plastic protective case -- items which were not clearly indicated on the Amazon site - ending up in my buying these extra.  The plastic case is okay -- but the Tap Fond I bought is definitely better -- fitted very well and has a nice finish and feel.  Without the case, the phone is very slippery for elderly seniors like me.  Overall, at half the price of my Nexus 5, I think it is great value for money.", "0 users found this review helpful", "4 stars", "21 Jun 2017,"], ["good phone and very fast with good camera but battery is average and i like lenovo u touch home button", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "21 Jun 2017,"], ["I bought this device mainly for 2 reasons:1. its powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor2. screen size (i don't like the 5.5 inch ones as they feel too big in hand)But I was disappointed after using it for the first few months.

There is a bug which doesn't let me receive , reject or do anything with a call.it just hangs there. I have to call  the person back again. This is the major thing that has bugged me twice a week. But , I was using the le1s before this and on occassion use to get the same problem there as well.2. The speaker is not that loud. It plays audio form the music player  loud enough , but the sound level falls while streaming YouTube or gaming.3. The camera is decent but certainly not impressive at this price range. The autofocus is good , but still gives blurry images once in a while.4.no built in radio app. I needed that.Now , the pros.1. The processor is the best thing about the phone. The Snapdragon 820 makes this phone run lagfree all time and even heavy games like asphalt8 are a cakewalk in this phone.2. The u touch is a 'all in one' magic button. I have disabled the on screen buttons. The operation is very smooth and one can switch between apps with ease and customise to your own style.3. The UI is good. The notification coming from the top and the settings menu coming from bottom enhances one hand use.4. I have been really impressed with the battery of this handset. A full charge gets me through the day easily. But, today I find it deserves much more appreciation. I am traveling and have been using it for the last 3 hours,,with constant music in the background , constantly switching between quota , whatsapp ,fb, instagram, toi, and some. light gaming with 4g  and it has dropped a mere 24% from 90% to 66%.and it can easily drag me through the rest of the day .My suggestion would be to go for it , if camera isn't your priority.

And now the phone runs as good as OnePlus 3 and Google Pixel.If you are a normal user then stay away from this phone however if you know how to unlock boot loader and flash custom rom then just go for this phone, with AEX ROM this phone turns into an absolute beast.About camera quality, well it's just average, it's better than Redmi Note 4 but nothing remarkable either.", "0 users found this review helpful", "4 stars", "26 May 2017,"], ["The product very hot while using internet for 5 minuits and while using normally for 10 minuits,It is money wasting product.after 5 minuits using we will switch off the phone because the phone too hot hold in hand.so i am not recommended .no one dont buy this phone", "0 users found this review helpful", "1 stars", "25 May 2017,"], ["Very bad phone and delivery is very very bad .", "0 users found this review helpful", "1 stars", "25 May 2017,"], ["Overall a very good product..got it for 9.3k..n it's a great deal..coming to the phone,it's pretty good in almost all aspects..don't expect a flagship experience for dis budget,but ya on processing part it is top notch..doesn't support fast charging..but bundled charger is sufficient to charge it in 80-90 mins..inbox case is pretty excellent..camera is decent..battery backup is impressive..there is a mild heating problem,but only when u run a graphic intensive games..Verdict: Definitely a good buy if u can grab one bet 10-12k price range", "0 users found this review helpful", "4 stars", "25 May 2017,"], ["Auto shutdown.", "0 users found this review helpful", "2 stars", "25 May 2017,"], ["When I thought to buy this one, I also had same hesitation whether to go for this or not. It is because of negative reviews.The negative reviews are about user interface, camera, battery life, heating etc.To be frank the UI will be new to us and we'll feel little uncomfortable while using. If u r comfortable with stock Android experience then try customroms. There are so many good customroms available.Camera is toooo good at this price range. I don't know why people r comparing this ones camera with costly mobiles.Battery life, I used redmi 3s prime previously n we know that 3s is having 4000 mah n SD430 n only HD n adreno 505 GPU its backup was 1.5 days. With SD820 4 GB ddr4 ram, adreno 530  z2 plus is giving same.Heating, its common in every mobile but is problem still. After installing custom ROM I didn't observe heating which is good. But it has heating problem with pre installed OS.My experience is,Great speed, very smooth. The best thing is U-touch key. You will love it. It will be difficult to others to handle your mobile but not you, 6 functions you can set.Ram management is toooo great, u can compare with mobiles around 50k in this aspect. Last night I played asphalt 8 n still it is there. Which is great. Now I don't need to wait to switch between apps.Display is great, no words to say. Didn't mention about gorilla glass in specs but I can observe a glass on screen, can be a tempered glass. Free back case also.Build quality is very good, looks like iPhone. It's thick but not heavy. Its having lithium ion battery which is good n safe compared to lithium polymer which can be dangerous some times. We r hearing the mobile blast cases with lithium polymer battery.Finally don't consider negative reviews bcz there will be problem with only some pieces not all.

ZUI tries to come close to stock Android but it still requires some refinement. The updates are a bit slow but i recently updated it to Nougat and it's working even better.Now coming to the camera, it's average to begin with but with Nougat update the image processing has been improved million folds and the camera quality is far better now.Battery life is great.The Snapdragon 820 lives up to its name. The performance is solid and ever so rarely do I find any hiccups.Sound quality is good but the i find the variance between the range of volume when I increase our decrease the volume to be too great.The package should have included a fast charger.I own the 4 GB version and it can retain a lot of apps and i rarely find any app restarting while switching between apps.The phone's build quality is solid (a little bulky) and I prefer to use a back cover as the glad back is slippery (The cover included in the package will do just fine).Lenovo should have marketed this phone better.Lastly, don't believe most of the negetive reviews as I feel must of them are fake.

The 2.5 D curved glass give a classy look..Coming toward the pros and cons.. I would first discuss cons..1. The rear camera is pretty fine in natural light but in artificial lighting it is not as good as moto g5 plus.. the front camera is not also good enough for selfie in dim light but one cam do in bright or natural light..2. The glass protection is not mentioned by the company which means u have to take care of the phone while putting it down to the table or somewhere else..3. Being a 2.5D glass is difficult to find a tempered glass in the market for best covering... Also the tempered glass and the back cover are not available in the all the market which means u have to buy it online with the phone itself.4. No radio, no eternal sd card slot, no quick charge supportive charger..That's it for the cons no more cons have been yet found by me..Now coming to the pros..1. The bestly managed RAM management I have seen till now.. believe me the RAM management of this phone is outstanding and never hangs for a single micro second..2. The finger print scanner works very quickly even if I place my thumb in any angle which makes it easy to open in any angle..3. As compared to other 20k phone it has the perfect speaker volume which is neither too low nor too high..4. the \"U Touch\" feature is just superb and a great concept initially it take time to get familiar with it but after some time it becomes very useful for quick swiping between the apps..So that's it..At last if U can compromise for the camera and want a phone with great performance.. just go for it..ThanksJigyasu Prakash", "0 users found this review helpful", "4 stars", "13 May 2017,"], ["ConsIt heats a bit but not above 45 degree.Volume is a bit low.ProsAmazing performance, no lag or hiccups even on heavy usage.U-Touch feature is awesome.Looks stylish and compact.Very good battery backup.Good camera.Highly recommend, go for it.", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "13 May 2017,"], ["There is an issue with internet connection", "0 users found this review helpful", "2 stars", "13 May 2017,"], ["Touch screen is pathetic.

Initial impressions were bad, because first thing i did after purchasing this phone was updating it to latest version. Speed was very poor( may be it was a fault of bsnl). After updating it to latest 2.5.104st, i found several bugs and one misspelling. I wasn't    happy about it because notifications    and quick drawer is designed in most unuseful way. There is severe bug in wifi display. If you move to 2.5.104st than your tv won't connect with your phone. Previous it used to work but it was buggy and frequent drops in frames were common. Phone will heat up if you use charger provided with it. I have oneplus 3 charger with me( from previous phone stolen in metro) that can charge it at normal speed but there is no heat or glitch in the screen. Volte works on sim1 only. Accessories and replacement parts are not available online. After getting underbaked android naugat update from lenovo,I unlocked my phone to see its potential. Installed various roms. Found that custom rom are much better than stock one, but there was a issue that no custom rom can resolve and it is      camera. Manual mode of zui is addictive. As it provides nice shots in very low light conditions. So i thought i should move to stock fireware again. I locked my phone stupidly and it became a brick( flickering zuk logo and battery logo and nothing else). I researched about it and after some time(total time was around 10 hours or more probably) i found qpst method to restore my phone software. But phone was not responding as it was getting into 900e. After using wire trick of bjoing black and green wires inside type c cable, i was able to boot into fastboot mode(9008). I flashed qpst rom and got my warranty back as well, because it locked bootloader again. Now after updating to 2.0.133st, i am getting update failed for next update to naugat. I can qpst it as well. But dropped the idea as marshmallow was less buggy than naugat. I checked Lenovo's upgrade matrix to know whether we will get any other update after 2.5.104st and according to it updates are completed for our smartphone. It means if you looking for a smartphone which delivers good performance and battery life but updates are not your concern than go for it. If you can get it at a price of 11k (32gb) or 13k(64gb) than go for it. If you are confused between z2 plus, mi5, oneplus 3, and leeco max2 and price is major factor than go for it. Do not buy mi5 or leeco max2, as both have major issues first one has weeker structural strength and later has service centres in india as leeco fired its 80% staff and only concentrating over tv bussiness. Oneplus 3 is perfect as compared to z2 plus but its price is more than twice. To sum it up:-1- display -5/5.2- battery - it depends on the rom you have but overall 4/5.3- software - 1/5. I wanted to give them 0 marks but they did make an effort yet they failed.4- performance -4/5 As phone might heat up in excessive gaming, otherwise performance and ram management is perfect   .Addtional features- fast charging, u touch, uhealth. Manual camera (in zui 2.5)Camera 2.5/5. It struggles a lot.Build quality - excellent but you will be in a big deep trouble if you break any glass( back or front).Call quality - excellent.Speakers - feeble but otherwise better than oneplus 3 speakers.Ram management is perfect but user interface is below average.Competition- mi5, moto g5, g4 plus, honor 6x, redmi note 4, and other chinese oems. All the reports about heating are true but they can be avoided easily if you reboot you phone twice just after getting updated software. My phone is does'nt heat up at all.If you like my Review, than please help out finding back panel replacement part. As we all will need in next few months.If you find some cool accessories for this phone please comment below.P.s.- I need one- less bulky case for our z2 plus.Update: - in any case you are not been able to apply naugat update than just go battery settings and turn off battery optimisation for google play services.

Connected on WiFi and ran almost a dozen apps simultaneously, but the discharge was slower than my anticipation.3) Fingerprint sensor is a little of a problem at times. It is perfect when it does work, but lags at times.4) Typing seems to be a bit of a bother at times. Space bar not working, or buttons in above row display. That could very well be my mistake, so not judging just yet.5) Rear camera is average. Not the sharpest tool in the shed, not even the sharper one. Front camera is pretty decent though. (not a photo person, so not complaining).6) Bloatware is almost non-existent. Three apps at best and all of which I was able to uninstall. A huge leap for Lenovo. The health app, though, I leave to your judgement.7) Lock screen is a little \"cropped\". The product images should give an idea.

Few Days ago i bought this device from Amazon as one of my good friends suggested me.\" The review may be somehow long but it will help the customers in making a decision. \"I'll be sharing my good as well as bad experience in this Review !_______________________________________So, here it starts:Build and Design: 7 / 10First things first, the Lenovo Z2 Plus is not going to win any awards for its thickness. At 8.49mm it is relatively thicker than its peers and after snapping on the stealth cover, it looks even more thicker. It doesn   t weigh much at 149 grams thankfully. There   s a glossy black glass back and the frame is made of fibreglass. From a distance it does resemble a black iPhone 5s, if you excuse the rectangular home button.Thanks to the 5-inch form factor, the phone fits well in the hand and there is a chamfering around the edges which does not leave any sharp edges. The rear side makes the phone a tad bit slippery to grip, thanks to the glossy surface. There is a physical button which also functions as a fingerprint scanner on the front. The button/scanner can do multiple functions which we will elaborate in the Software section.The volume rocker and power/standby buttons are present above the dual SIM card tray on the right hand side, and look a bit too plasticky. Top and left hand edges are clean. At the bottom edge, you have the 3.5mm audio jack, microphone, USB Type C port for charging and data transfer and the mono speaker.The design is functional and nothing that will make the Lenovo Z2 Plus stand out among the crowd. Build quality is relatively sturdy as well, but the rear glossy cover is a dust magnet.Features: 8 / 10Lenovo Z2 Plus packs in a lot of goodies. For starters, there   s the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset. This is for all purposes, the flagship SoC (yes, we know the Snapdragon 821 is also out). The Snapdragon 820 SoC comes with a quad core Kyro CPU clocked at 2.15GHz with Adreno 530 graphics solution. It is paired with 4GB of DDR4 RAM and 64GB of storage out of which around 58.7GB is available to the user.There is no provision to expand the storage by adding in a microSD card. For storage, Lenovo Z2 Plus uses a SanDisk i7232 smartSLC storage which basically has a small portion of the storage with SLC memory which is faster than traditional flash storage.It runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow, and  is quite close to stock version. There are a few custom apps though on the Lenovo Z2 Plus. But unlike the ZUK Z1, there is no CyanogenMod OS on top of Android. It has a 5-inch FullHD display.The Lenovo Z2 Plus comes with a dual nano SIM configuration which can take in two 4G SIM cards and also has support for 4G+, VoLTE. It supports Wi-Fi 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS with A-GPS and GLONASS, there   s a USB Type C port for data transfer, NFC, FM Radio is not supported, which may be a bummer.Display: 8 / 10In an age of being surrounded by 5.5-inch devices, it is pleasant when you get a flagship level phone with a 5-inch display. The Lenovo Z2 Plus comes with a 5-inch Full HD glossy display giving it a pixel density of 441ppi.The display is sharp as one would expect at such high pixel density. Viewing angles are good. Colours are natural although there is a slight blush tinge to the display. It comes with a Corning Gorilla Glass to protect the display.The display looked good both indoors as well as outdoors. While shooting in bright sunlight there are issues such as dark areas not being properly visible. Watching YouTube videos is a pleasant affair thanks to a decent contrast.Software: 7.5 / 1 0For all practical purposes, the Lenovo Z2 Plus comes with a stock Android 6.0 Marshmallow OS. It is not skinned like the Lenovo Vibe series phones. But just like the Moto phones, the OS does have some custom apps and some bloatware in the form of 9Apps, Hasoffer, Hotoday and so on.It comes with a U Health app which monitors your daily steps and shows you daily, weekly, monthly charts, just like Google Fit. There are slight variations with accessing the quick menu. You will need to swipe from bottom upwards and you see a floating quick options menu. This is a stupid attempt at trying to ape Apple, and I didn   t like it much. Half the time you end up the home soft key or have to swipe up multiple times to bring up the quick options. Notifications can be accessed by swiping from top downwards as usual. Lenovo could have just gone and added another tab beside the notifications which is the most sensible thing to do. You get a 2  4 grid of quick options which can be swiped to reveal more options.But the most interesting addition is the home button / finger print scanner customisations. Called the U touch fingerprint sensor, it supports certain gestures on the button. For instance, pressing on the button once takes you to the home page, pressing the button twice brings up recent apps, swiping left and right on the button opens previous apps and so on. It is a nice implementationYou can switch off the onscreen buttons thereby getting more screen real estate. Long pressing home button or long touch on the home button can also trigger further actions, such as going to sleep, apps history, notification centre or even triggering an app to open. This is one of the most fun implementation of the button I have seen and really does cut down thumb travel.Performance: 8 / 10Call quality is quite good and the earpiece speaker is loud enough even in traffic situations. The audio speaker on the base sounds muffled though. There were many instances where I could barely hear audio while playing some videos, despite being on maximum volume level. It is best to get a good pair of earphones.Benchmark scores are in line with what one gets with the Xiaomi Mi 5, and slightly lower than that of the OnePlus 3, LG G5, HTC 10 among the Snapdragon 820 chipset sporting phones. Barring the multi-core score on the Geekbench 4 score, there weren   t any discrepancies in other scores.Gaming performance was quite good with no frame drops observed while playing Asphalt 8: Airborne, Dead Trigger 2, Modern Combat 5. The maximum temperatures as recorded by the Fluke IR thermometer on the back of the Z2 Plus after a heavy gaming session were around 35 degrees Celcius. While shooting for longer periods does heat up the phone, but again the temperatures aren   t unbearably hot. The heat management is good overall.Fingerprint scanner is good, though not the fastest around. But the major U touch feature which lets you program your home button to perform tasks such as swiping left and right, long press and long hold, works quite well. Yes, there is a slight learning curve involved. But once you have set it up, you are good to go.Camera: 6.5 / 10The Lenovo Z2 Plus comes with a 13MP ISOCELL rear camera with 1.34 micron pixel size and an f/2.2 aperture which is complemented with a 8MP front-facing camera with a 1.4 micron pixel size. The rear camera is capable to shooting 4K videos and the front camera can shoot up to full HD video. The Z2 Plus also supports slow motion shooting at 120fps, 480fps and 960fps     with decreasing resolutions. The camera interface is slightly modified from a stock Google camera. The menu options present themselves in a circular sort of layout. There is no manual shooting mode.Image quality in the daylight was quite good, with images showing a good amount of detail. Focussing speed is quick. But sharpness is not the best as you will notice fine objects such as fur, dense foliage and so on showing a waxy surface on 100 percent zoom. Lowlight and indoor shots show noise, and the sharpness goes for a toss. Focussing speeds also aren   t the best. With HDR mode, we noticed that the balancing of highlight and shadow regions isn   t satisfactory. We got a lot of blown out photos when we metered for the shadow region and vice versa. Since there is no manual control, you cannot really tweak much. You will need a third party camera app for that.Video quality is fine as long as the camera is steady. It does allow 4K video recording, but quality is just about average. There is a slow motion mode at 960fps, which isn   t really true slow motion. You can notice jagged edges as compared to the same clip shot on say 120fps, despite the resolution being same. There seems to be some software level trickery at play here.On the whole, the camera is definitely not the strong aspect of the Lenovo Z2 Plus.Battery: 8 / 10It houses a 3500mAh battery which is non-removable. It supports Intelligent Charge Cut-off technology which takes power from the AC power source after the battery is 100 percent charged. The battery life turned out to be quite good, with PC Mark for Android giving an impressive 10 hours 10 minutes. Even in our daily use case, which involves messaging, calling, two email accounts on syncs, audio and video streaming, the phone would last from 8AM to around 10PM before going under 10 percent. It supports QuickCharge 2.0 and bundles in a 2A charger in the box.Verdict and Price in IndiaSo let us answer that one question that is the norm when it comes to Snapdragon 820 chipset sporting smartphones      Is this phone better than the OnePlus 3? Well, No. There are many areas where  OnePlus 3  still excels such as camera, build quality, performance and so on.But under Rs 20,000 price bracket, the Lenovo Z2 Plus has little competition. It is preferable to go for the 4GB RAM / 64GB storage variant of the Z2 Plus      it just makes sense to spend Rs 2000 more than the base model. With the Z2 Plus you are getting a flagship level chipset in the mid-range segment pricing. So it will definitely appeal to the college going crowd or someone who is upgrading from sub-Rs 10,000 phone.Battery life, compact form factor, good display, fast performance are some of the positives of the Lenovo Z2 Plus. But camera is a disappointment, as it performs at par with any of the sub Rs 15,000 smartphones. It is great for casual photo sharing, but definitely not meant for camera enthusiasts. The  Xiaomi mi 5  which is slightly higher in price, offers a much better camera and build quality.So it all boils down to what matters to you. If you   re fine with a functional camera and want a long lasting phone with great performance, the the Z2 Plus offers a compelling reason to buy it.", "0 users found this review helpful", "3 stars", "19 Mar 2017,"], ["I purchased this , Device a month ago , and I am really satisfied with it .

Few Days ago i bought this device from Amazon as one of my good friends suggested me.\" The review may be somehow long but it will help the customers in making a decision. \"I'll be sharing my good as well as bad experience in this Review !_______________________________________So, here it starts:Build and Design: 7 / 10First things first, the Lenovo Z2 Plus is not going to win any awards for its thickness. At 8.49mm it is relatively thicker than its peers and after snapping on the stealth cover, it looks even more thicker. It doesn   t weigh much at 149 grams thankfully. There   s a glossy black glass back and the frame is made of fibreglass. From a distance it does resemble a black iPhone 5s, if you excuse the rectangular home button.Thanks to the 5-inch form factor, the phone fits well in the hand and there is a chamfering around the edges which does not leave any sharp edges. The rear side makes the phone a tad bit slippery to grip, thanks to the glossy surface. There is a physical button which also functions as a fingerprint scanner on the front. The button/scanner can do multiple functions which we will elaborate in the Software section.The volume rocker and power/standby buttons are present above the dual SIM card tray on the right hand side, and look a bit too plasticky. Top and left hand edges are clean. At the bottom edge, you have the 3.5mm audio jack, microphone, USB Type C port for charging and data transfer and the mono speaker.The design is functional and nothing that will make the Lenovo Z2 Plus stand out among the crowd. Build quality is relatively sturdy as well, but the rear glossy cover is a dust magnet.Features: 8 / 10Lenovo Z2 Plus packs in a lot of goodies. For starters, there   s the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset. This is for all purposes, the flagship SoC (yes, we know the Snapdragon 821 is also out). The Snapdragon 820 SoC comes with a quad core Kyro CPU clocked at 2.15GHz with Adreno 530 graphics solution. It is paired with 4GB of DDR4 RAM and 64GB of storage out of which around 58.7GB is available to the user.There is no provision to expand the storage by adding in a microSD card. For storage, Lenovo Z2 Plus uses a SanDisk i7232 smartSLC storage which basically has a small portion of the storage with SLC memory which is faster than traditional flash storage.It runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow, and  is quite close to stock version. There are a few custom apps though on the Lenovo Z2 Plus. But unlike the ZUK Z1, there is no CyanogenMod OS on top of Android. It has a 5-inch FullHD display.The Lenovo Z2 Plus comes with a dual nano SIM configuration which can take in two 4G SIM cards and also has support for 4G+, VoLTE. It supports Wi-Fi 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS with A-GPS and GLONASS, there   s a USB Type C port for data transfer, NFC, FM Radio is not supported, which may be a bummer.Display: 8 / 10In an age of being surrounded by 5.5-inch devices, it is pleasant when you get a flagship level phone with a 5-inch display. The Lenovo Z2 Plus comes with a 5-inch Full HD glossy display giving it a pixel density of 441ppi.The display is sharp as one would expect at such high pixel density. Viewing angles are good. Colours are natural although there is a slight blush tinge to the display. It comes with a Corning Gorilla Glass to protect the display.The display looked good both indoors as well as outdoors. While shooting in bright sunlight there are issues such as dark areas not being properly visible. Watching YouTube videos is a pleasant affair thanks to a decent contrast.Software: 7.5 / 1 0For all practical purposes, the Lenovo Z2 Plus comes with a stock Android 6.0 Marshmallow OS. It is not skinned like the Lenovo Vibe series phones. But just like the Moto phones, the OS does have some custom apps and some bloatware in the form of 9Apps, Hasoffer, Hotoday and so on.It comes with a U Health app which monitors your daily steps and shows you daily, weekly, monthly charts, just like Google Fit. There are slight variations with accessing the quick menu. You will need to swipe from bottom upwards and you see a floating quick options menu. This is a stupid attempt at trying to ape Apple, and I didn   t like it much. Half the time you end up the home soft key or have to swipe up multiple times to bring up the quick options. Notifications can be accessed by swiping from top downwards as usual. Lenovo could have just gone and added another tab beside the notifications which is the most sensible thing to do. You get a 2  4 grid of quick options which can be swiped to reveal more options.But the most interesting addition is the home button / finger print scanner customisations. Called the U touch fingerprint sensor, it supports certain gestures on the button. For instance, pressing on the button once takes you to the home page, pressing the button twice brings up recent apps, swiping left and right on the button opens previous apps and so on. It is a nice implementationYou can switch off the onscreen buttons thereby getting more screen real estate. Long pressing home button or long touch on the home button can also trigger further actions, such as going to sleep, apps history, notification centre or even triggering an app to open. This is one of the most fun implementation of the button I have seen and really does cut down thumb travel.Performance: 8 / 10Call quality is quite good and the earpiece speaker is loud enough even in traffic situations. The audio speaker on the base sounds muffled though. There were many instances where I could barely hear audio while playing some videos, despite being on maximum volume level. It is best to get a good pair of earphones.Benchmark scores are in line with what one gets with the Xiaomi Mi 5, and slightly lower than that of the OnePlus 3, LG G5, HTC 10 among the Snapdragon 820 chipset sporting phones. Barring the multi-core score on the Geekbench 4 score, there weren   t any discrepancies in other scores.Gaming performance was quite good with no frame drops observed while playing Asphalt 8: Airborne, Dead Trigger 2, Modern Combat 5. The maximum temperatures as recorded by the Fluke IR thermometer on the back of the Z2 Plus after a heavy gaming session were around 35 degrees Celcius. While shooting for longer periods does heat up the phone, but again the temperatures aren   t unbearably hot. The heat management is good overall.Fingerprint scanner is good, though not the fastest around. But the major U touch feature which lets you program your home button to perform tasks such as swiping left and right, long press and long hold, works quite well. Yes, there is a slight learning curve involved. But once you have set it up, you are good to go.Camera: 6.5 / 10The Lenovo Z2 Plus comes with a 13MP ISOCELL rear camera with 1.34 micron pixel size and an f/2.2 aperture which is complemented with a 8MP front-facing camera with a 1.4 micron pixel size. The rear camera is capable to shooting 4K videos and the front camera can shoot up to full HD video. The Z2 Plus also supports slow motion shooting at 120fps, 480fps and 960fps     with decreasing resolutions. The camera interface is slightly modified from a stock Google camera. The menu options present themselves in a circular sort of layout. There is no manual shooting mode.Image quality in the daylight was quite good, with images showing a good amount of detail. Focussing speed is quick. But sharpness is not the best as you will notice fine objects such as fur, dense foliage and so on showing a waxy surface on 100 percent zoom. Lowlight and indoor shots show noise, and the sharpness goes for a toss. Focussing speeds also aren   t the best. With HDR mode, we noticed that the balancing of highlight and shadow regions isn   t satisfactory. We got a lot of blown out photos when we metered for the shadow region and vice versa. Since there is no manual control, you cannot really tweak much. You will need a third party camera app for that.Video quality is fine as long as the camera is steady. It does allow 4K video recording, but quality is just about average. There is a slow motion mode at 960fps, which isn   t really true slow motion. You can notice jagged edges as compared to the same clip shot on say 120fps, despite the resolution being same. There seems to be some software level trickery at play here.On the whole, the camera is definitely not the strong aspect of the Lenovo Z2 Plus.Battery: 8 / 10It houses a 3500mAh battery which is non-removable. It supports Intelligent Charge Cut-off technology which takes power from the AC power source after the battery is 100 percent charged. The battery life turned out to be quite good, with PC Mark for Android giving an impressive 10 hours 10 minutes. Even in our daily use case, which involves messaging, calling, two email accounts on syncs, audio and video streaming, the phone would last from 8AM to around 10PM before going under 10 percent. It supports QuickCharge 2.0 and bundles in a 2A charger in the box.Verdict and Price in IndiaSo let us answer that one question that is the norm when it comes to Snapdragon 820 chipset sporting smartphones      Is this phone better than the OnePlus 3? Well, No. There are many areas where  OnePlus 3  still excels such as camera, build quality, performance and so on.But under Rs 20,000 price bracket, the Lenovo Z2 Plus has little competition. It is preferable to go for the 4GB RAM / 64GB storage variant of the Z2 Plus      it just makes sense to spend Rs 2000 more than the base model. With the Z2 Plus you are getting a flagship level chipset in the mid-range segment pricing. So it will definitely appeal to the college going crowd or someone who is upgrading from sub-Rs 10,000 phone.Battery life, compact form factor, good display, fast performance are some of the positives of the Lenovo Z2 Plus. But camera is a disappointment, as it performs at par with any of the sub Rs 15,000 smartphones. It is great for casual photo sharing, but definitely not meant for camera enthusiasts. The  Xiaomi mi 5  which is slightly higher in price, offers a much better camera and build quality.So it all boils down to what matters to you. If you   re fine with a functional camera and want a long lasting phone with great performance, the the Z2 Plus offers a compelling reason to buy it.", "0 users found this review helpful", "3 stars", "19 Mar 2017,"], ["Product spec is too good to be believed selling at 10999 during sale.

It is good in terms of performance, battery backup, charging speed, fingerprint sensor, ram management and multitasking. But ZUI has lots of issues. Some issues I faced1) Sometime when locked touch was not working.2) I was not able to receive calls due to above issue.3) After dialing a number phone screen used to go black and touch was not responding at the time. I had to restart phone to cut the call.4) Phone was intelligent enough to automatically reboot in between the call sometime. So that won't have to cut the call.5) Notification bar has some usability issues. Like you cannot reply Whatsapp messages from the notification as in stock androids.6) Call quality was not good. Receiving voice was not very clear.Lenovo service is not good. Their online assistant advised me to go to service center while service center was not receiving the call.So I requested Amazon to please take it back and initiate refund. Initially they said they will do replacement but after contacting them 5 6 times they agreed for return.

Performance- SD 820!2. Price- Under 15k!3. Build- the roll cage design( lost my g2 due to phusical damage).The facts-1. Performance- awesome!! On par with One+33. Build-It has got the most functional build I have seen. It feels like its indestructible and drops dont have too much impact barring scratches. But!! Its got near flat edges, so it isnt very comfortable in the hand.4. Camera- both front and camera are good in daylight. Will comfortably do your social media duties with ease. Not a deal breaker.5. Heating issue- honestly, the phone heats up, a lot when u use it constantly but again all phones do and with so much performance, its understandable. ( Warning- if the phone heats up too much, take it to the service centre, issue should be fixed. Which happened to me)6. Ergonomics- for people comfortable with small phones, the choices are limited! However, the glass back makes it the slippest things you'll ever use. Probably can be used to test the flatness of a surface :)7. Battery backup- a day with 4G data used throughout, not many phones can do that! U dont miss quick charge a lot but it would help.8. Updates- remember this is not a moto( even they are getting bad) so don't expect the latest software.9. Custom ROMs- if u hate the UI and want to try other ROMs( which is probably the only reason u would), u will be disappointed. The dev community isnt that great with very few good ROMs.10. Customisations- again there aren't a lot of aftermarket skins and back cover available ( should say something;)2. Cost- this is just a personal opinion based on above facts.My conclusion-1. The phone isn't useable without a back cover because of the heat and the glass back.2. Do not buy this phone if u think ur getting a flagship phone. It does have the specs but its implementations are to be improved or if u can live with a bigger phones( the flat edges kill it here).3.

To be safe, I unplugged it and it cooled down after a bit, but guess what, the phone doesnt charge anymore! I rebooted the phone but no luck.

Disappointed. I'm giving my honest opinions about this phone, please read full review before buying.It has a slightly smaller 5-inch 1080p LTPS 2.5D curved glass screen with a pixel density of about 441 ppi. It also has Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display is glossy and is prone to fingerprints. The display is bright, colors are vibrant, viewing angles and the sunlight legibility are good as well. it is really compact to use for one-handed usage.There is also a tiny notification LED on the right side of the earpiece that glow in white color. Apart from the usual set of proximity and ambient light sensors, it also has gyroscope and magnetic sensor otherwise known as magnetometer.It has a home button below the display that also houses a fingerprint sensor. But it doesn   t have capacitive touch buttons, so you have to use on-screen buttons.The phone has a metal frame and is 8.45mm thick. The volume rockers, power button and the SIM slot are present on the right side. The 3.5mm audio jack, primary microphone, USB Type-C port and the loudspeaker grill are crammed on the bottom.You need to use the bundled SIM ejector tool to remove the SIM slot that fits two nano SIMs in a single tray. The phone doesn   t have a microSD card slot, which might be a problem since for most since the phone comes in 32GB and 64GB storage options to fulfill the storage needs.The phone has a glossy glass back so it is prone to fingerprints. It also comes in white color in which the fingerprints are not visible. Even though the sides of the phone are not slippery, the back is quite slippery so it is recommended to use the bundled Stealth Case that also protects the sides of the phone. The phone is 141.65mm tall and 68.88mm wide that is slightly more compact compared to the Xiaomi Mi 5 with a slightly bigger 5.15-inch screen. It weighs just 149 grams even though it packs a huge 3500mAh battery.According to Lenovo that phone has a roll cage design that doesn   t damage the internals when the phone falls. Overall the phone has a good build quality.CameraThe Z2 Plus has a 13-megapixel rear camera with ISOCELL Sensor, f/2.2 aperture, PDAF and CAF auto focus, 1.34um pixels single LED flash and an 8-megapixel front-facing camera with 1.4um pixels and f/2.0 aperture.The camera UI is simple with option to toggle flash, HDR, video camera, front camera and view images. Settings option lets you switch to slo-mo mode, time-lapse, choose aspect ratio (1:1 and 4:3) and panorama. You can also choose grid and location from the settings. It lacks RAW (.DNG) shooting and also doesn   t have manual mode. You can   t even control the exposure and white balance.Coming to the image quality, daylight shots are good with all the details. HDR shots are good as well, but sometimes it is hard to focus for macro shots even with PDAF and CAF options, otherwise it takes less than a second to focus. Images with flash are good since it is not over powering but low-light shots are poor and have a lot of noise.It can record videos at 4K resolution at 30 fps. Videos have good details and the audio is crisp, thanks to the secondary microphone. It has slow motion video recording at 120 fps, 240 fps and 960 fps at 720p. It just reduces the frame rate from the original video, so the quality is not that good. It doesn   t have OIS and only has EIS, which is software stabilization.The smartphone runs on Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) with Lenovo   s own ZUI 2.0 on top. The Indian version comes with the Google Now launcher compared to the default launch of ZUI, but still the settings and the other things are same. Lenovo has not announced its Android 7.0 (Nougat) roadmap yet.One of the main drawbacks in the ZUI is that the notifications do not expand, so you can   t delete an email or reply to a WhatsApp message directly from the notification.In the 4GB RAM variant with 64GB storage, you get 3.7GB of usable RAM and 52.86GB of storage out of the box. You really can   t see the free RAM in the ZUI. It uses SanDisk   s i7232 NANDflash storage with SmartSLC architecture for faster data transfer.Other than the usual set of utility apps and Google apps, it comes pre-loaded with 9Apps, Amazon, Hasoffer, Hotoday and Superb Clean.It also has U Health app that keeps track of your steps, calories burnt and distance. You need to input age, height and weight, and it calculates BMI and recommends a daily goal of steps. The trends tab lets you view steps, active time and active burn based on day, week, month or year.It uses a dedicated sensor processing unit (SPU) to monitor these. If you don   t have a fitness band, you can rely on this to use it as activity tracker since this can clearly distinguish between a walk, run and commute.The fingerprint sensor is present below the display. Placement of the sensor below the display is good for a compact phone since it can be used easily when holding the phone. It is quick to unlock the phone most of the times as soon as you place your finger on the sensor and offers haptic feedback if detects a wrong fingerprint. It unlocks the phone even when the screen is off, so you don   t need to unlock the phone for the fingerprint recognition to work. You can add up to 5 fingerprints.Lenovo says that this has a self-learning algorithm that detects irregularities (skin peel, wound, dry skin, etc.) and adjusts accordingly. It also says that it has CAC algorithm to unlock wet and oily fingers, but it doesn   t detect if the finger is too wet.It has Dual SIM option in the settings that lets you customize each SIM cards. It has 4G connectivity with support for LTE bands for India and also supports VoLTE (Voice-over-LTE) out of the box. Both the SIM slots have 4G support, but you can use 4G on only one SIM at a time, while the other goes to 2G. Other connectivity options include, WiFi 802.11 ac (2.4GHz + 5GHz), Bluetooth 4.1 and GPS. It also has USB OTG (on-the-go) support, but lacks NFC support.Performance and BenchmarksIt is powered by a Quad-Core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 64-bit 14nm processor that has two custom Kryo cores clocked at 2.15GHz per core and two smaller Kryo cores are clocked at 1.59GHz per core. It has 624 MHz Adreno 530 GPU and 4GB LPDDR4 RAM. The performance is good without any lags. I tested several games, which were smooth and graphics is also good. The phone gets heated quickly during intensive gaming and when using the camera, even though the company says that it has good thermal management.The Z2 Plus packs a 3500mAh built-in battery, slightly smaller than the ZUK Z1   s 4100mAh battery. With average use it lasts easily for 2 days, with heavy use such as gaming, 4G and music playback, it lasts for a day mainly due to small screen and good battery management. You can enable battery saver to extend the battery life when the battery is low. Even though it doesn   t come with quick charger in the box, it has Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 that can charge the phone fully in less than 1 and half hours. The phone gets heated when using the charger, which is common in fast charging.Lenovo says that it has intelligent charge cut (ICC) off feature which intelligently prevents unnecessary charge cycles extending the battery life.In my battery test the Lenovo Z2 Plus achieved a One Charge Rating of 13 hours and 54 minutes, which is good compared to the ZUK Z1 that achieved rating of 14 hours and 41 minutes even with a 4100mAh battery, but it less than the One Charge Rating of Xiaomi Mi 5 that has a rating of 18 hours and 19 minutes. Check out the complete set of battery test results here.ConclusionLenovo has priced the second-generation ZUK smartphone competitive at a starting price of Rs. 17,999, similar to its predecessor. The Lenovo Z2 Plus comes as the first choice under Rs. 20,000 for those who are looking for a compact smartphone that is powerful, offers good battery life and has a good build quality. The fingerprint sensor is fast, but it has minor heating issues. One of the main drawbacks is the poor low-light camera performance and lack of manual control.If you need a better camera with OIS, manual camera mode and an Infrared sensor, the close competitor is the Xiaomi Mi 5 that usually gets a temporary price cut during festive sales.The Lenovo Z2 Plus is currently available exclusively from Amazon.in.

It also has Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. The display is glossy and is prone to fingerprints. The display is bright, colors are vibrant, viewing angles and the sunlight legibility are good as well. it is really compact to use for one-handed usage.There is also a tiny notification LED on the right side of the earpiece that glow in white color. Apart from the usual set of proximity and ambient light sensors, it also has gyroscope and magnetic sensor otherwise known as magnetometer.It has a home button below the display that also houses a fingerprint sensor. But it doesn   t have capacitive touch buttons, so you have to use on-screen buttons.The phone has a metal frame and is 8.45mm thick. The volume rockers, power button and the SIM slot are present on the right side. The 3.5mm audio jack, primary microphone, USB Type-C port and the loudspeaker grill are crammed on the bottom.You need to use the bundled SIM ejector tool to remove the SIM slot that fits two nano SIMs in a single tray. The phone doesn   t have a microSD card slot, which might be a problem since for most since the phone comes in 32GB and 64GB storage options to fulfill the storage needs.The phone has a glossy glass back so it is prone to fingerprints. It also comes in white color in which the fingerprints are not visible. Even though the sides of the phone are not slippery, the back is quite slippery so it is recommended to use the bundled Stealth Case that also protects the sides of the phone.

With a Snapdragon 820 and either 3/4 GB RAM depending on the model . You get a great fast phone that is smooth and snappy with all applications and multitasking.Camera is good and should serve you well for a few quick photos every now and then .Works brilliant and in good natural lighting the photos are beautiful. The camera takes photos really fast which is great and the front facing camera is also decent for the most part . But that's not the main priority on this phone and this is not the best camera phone out there .The fingerprint sensor is fast and unlocks instantly when you place your finger on it . You don't need to press the fingerprint cum home button here to unlock .Just placing your finger is enough which is superb . Lenovo has also built some additional customisable functions into the fingerprint button which you can use and customise to move within the UI or open specific apps .For eg . If you double click the button you can either open the multitasking view and see open apps or swiping on the fingerprint sensor cycles through previously opened apps in memory.The battery life is also great .Over the last few days I easily get around 1.5 days of use before I need to charge.The phone has superb standby .When idle the battery doesn't loose much charge  .Note that my usage included mostly using apps like What'sapp and browsing web .A few YouTube videos on Wifi and one hour and an hour of playing some music of some light gaming .All in all this adds to a screen on time of 6 hours .Also note I got this battery life with only one SIM being used in the phone .The phone supports dual SIM . But no expandable card slot . I found my 64Gb version sufficient and shouldn't need extra memory .From the start I had 54GB available to useSound quality is pretty standard .Not something you can call extraordinary .It does sound very nice on a good pair of headphonesFinally the UI is not stock Android here .It does use the Google play launcher .If stock Android is what you prefer the only options are the Moto phones or Google Pixel.Underneath this phone runs Lenovo's own ZUI based on Android Marshmallow 6.0 .The OS runs fast with no lags at all thanks to the powerful Snapdragon 820 chip in the phone . There is a upgrade planned to Android N 7.0 which would be great and bring some of the improvements in the latest Android to this phone .To conclude this phone has one of the best chipsets  for the price.

The phone was very much of my liking as in small screen, High RAM, High Memory and touch at the front instead of back..... but my wish shattered when i got the phone the first look doesn't impress me at all:1. Shape : I know the thickness of the phone was high but this phone was feeling really bulky mainly because of the sharp corners. There is no curvature at the back which makes it difficult to sit on the palm conveniently.2. Screen guard : Going further it has mat finish screen cover which is nice but takes away the look of the phone.3. Case : The case was hopeless. It got loose after 3 times removal and the phone starting to play during plug-in plug-out for charging.4: SIM slot : looks really cheap and was super delicate. There was a play in the SIM slot and phone as well.Anyway still all of these are manageable if we buy new covers and screen guard etc.The real bummer caused when i charged the phone for the first time and kept it over night and the next day i saw a bubble on the screen. Now it looks like it was inside the screen not inside screen guard. I became furious and tried for a return and found out that i had to use the software from the phone for the return. Doing so i didn't found any option for my problem so i called Amazon Care and they asked to send them the Pics (since it was physical damage thing). Amazon care executive was a charm and they initiated the return request themselves and told me to return the phone the next day. They worked really fast so 5 stars to Amazon.Phone 2:Well i was satisfied as i read lot of reviews that how they could not return the phone and poor support from Amazon. The 2nd phone arrived and as usual i did all the necessary activities like software update and app installations. The first day went really well and there was no issue after charging like the first case ( my understanding of the 1st case was that the heating of the phone during charging surfaced the damage on the screen thus 1st charging was imp ).  But the good didn't lasted long and again after 3 days of usage in one fine afternoon the phone started behaving abruptly like i have mentioned below:1. Lock screen : It wasn't working. Cant pick call or unlock the phone. Good that i have uploaded the finger print unlock otherwise i cudnt had been able to unlock the phone.2. Calling : Whenever i tried to call the phone screen goes dark. no response at all. The phone was ON as the notification was blinking.3. Brightness : I cudnt able to set the brightness as the slider was resetting itself to zero brightness automatically ( and please dont think that it was because of the auto brightness ON condition as it happened with or without that).4. Screen off : Screen was automatically went off whenever i hold the phone to vertical from horizontal position.5. Lock screen no response : The lock screen wasnt responding by any buttons or finger print. To unlock i tried either of the two options, left the phone idle for few minutes and then try or repeated (over 10 times) pressing of unlock button.6. Restarting: Repeated restarting whenever starting any application. specially occurred during making calls.7. No response : Stopped responding at all. i would say it hanged maybe ( generally in the earlier times when phones used to hang then we used to take out the battery and everything worked fine later on but here that option is not available as battery is non removable type ).I was tolerating all of the above issues but ultimately my patients got lost when on the 7th day the 7th issue (mentioned above) appeared. I tried to reset the phone somehow through repeated clicking of buttons but it didnt help i also left the phone to discharge completely so that i can restart it again but no use. So it was 9th day now as i left the phone as such for a day n all and the return request time was getting over so i took the SIM and inserted it on the older phone and called Amazon care again for the 2nd time and explained my issue and why i cant use the software for the return. Amazon care executive told that they understood but cant initiate the return from their side and suggested me to go to Lenovo Care and get the phone checked. This statement made me irritated thus i had to say that i dont have time for all this and asked them to take responsibility for the actions of selling a non tested and faulty product exclusively through Amazon. After few minutes of words with them I have been asked to keep on Hold for 2 minutes ( 2 minutes means 2 minutes not 5 or 4 or even 3. so 5 stars to Amazon here again). I explained that i have the video of the actual problem in case they need it but they said its not required. And after few repeated holds and information sharing, the executive said that there a good news and my return is possible and that they will manually do it but i have to return the phone tomorrow only in the morning. I said no problem and what about the replacement, on that, they said since this has happened for the 2nd time thus i can get refund, thus i said to refund only, no more replacements.Phewww... job done...General Comments:I would thank AMAZON for the help they extended and supported when i needed them. So in my review i will give FIVE stars for their service support. ONE star to Lenovo for such 'bekar' phone with so many issues. Some other issues were also observed which are :1. Battery : not that great even with 3500. it discharged to 10% by the end of my ofc hours ( 12 hours of ofc including commute ).2. Notification light : tiny white light isnt much of a use.3. Sound quality : not that great4. Camera : we all know thru various reviews that it's not very good5. Lock screen notification : Not provided6. Gestures : Not availableBut it wasn't all that bad, there was some good too :1. Software : Notification on top and quick settings at the bottom ( good for one hand usage ). customization for notification for all apps.2. U-touch : it was really good specially for one hand usage. takes time to get used to but helpful.3. Hardware : there were no lags ( till the time it was working OK ) and fast like, u touch it and the app was there.4. No over heating issue : Yes there wasnt except if u charge and use the phone at the same time then it gets really hot and it can be felt through the case.5. No bloatware : good thing6. Other points are available in the various professional reviews.That's all i can figure out in the few days of usage. Hit Helpful if it was really helpful.P.S.: Thinking of buying Oneplus 3.

This not really new and there are third-party apps that do it well. However, the Z2 has fused it with the processor to bring power consumption down to negligible levels. For those who don   t want to invest in an extra fitness band, this seems like a good backup option.Lenovo phones have been quite popular in India over the past few years. However, not everyone is a fan of the UI. The company seems to be learning from this and on the Z2 Plus, the default launcher is Google Now, which is almost as good as going pure Android. Overall, this experience is really good.The phone performs quite decently, though there were a couple of hiccups I noticed. Also, the benchmark scores are not really out of this world if that is something you take seriously. Still, this phone does not heat up at all and has a battery that will last you 24 hours of serious use.The rear camera is very good and offers some good shots with subtleties of light.

I have compared Coolpad Cool 1 with Zuk Z2 Plus and at last given a final verdict whether you should buy Zuk or go with Coolpad.So, If you are thinking of BUYING this mobile or have SHORTLISTED it, then you must read my EXPERIENCE about Lenovo Zuk Z2 Plus. If you do not want to read the WHOLE REVIEW, simply read the DEAL MAKER, DEAL BREAKER and CONCLUSION SECTIONS and you will DEFINITELY know whether to buy this phone or not.Also KUDOS from me to you, THE READER, as YOU are a SMART BUYER who is first THOROUGHLY RESEARCHING about the product and THEN THINKING whether to PURCHASE it or not. CHEERS!___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________A) FEATURES WHICH MATTERS AND NOT JUST SPECS SHEET ::(i) CAMERA---} This mobile has a 8 Mega Pixel front facing camera WITHOUT LED FLASH. The front facing camera is EXCELLENT and you will not have any complaint in future regarding it.--} The primary camera is a 13 Mega Pixel shooter with PDAF and Professional Mode. Also, it can shoot videos at 4K resolution which is just excellent in this price segment though you can get DUAL CAMERA 4K recording with Coolpad Cool 1 but it's processor is not that great as the Zuk Z2 Plus has. Though, Cool 1 offers a DUAL CAMERAS with also 4K shooting capabilities.CAMERA RATING ::PRIMARY CAMERA : 9/10SECONDARY/SELFIE CAMERA: 8.6/10___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________(ii) SCREEN---} This headset comes with a 5 inch FULL HD LCD display with 441 pixels per inch which is MORE THAN SUFFICIENT for GAMING AND DAILY USAGE and the screen DOES NOT feel PIXELATED or LESS CRISPY at all. If you are into VIRTUAL REALITY, you will have an GOOD EXPERIENCE as due to the small size, the pixel density is GREAT and so the quality of the VR magnifying is also great. It comes with a GORILLA GLASS 3 PROTECTION so your screen is always safe.--} You should thoroughly consider whether you are satisfied with a 5 inch screen or not. If not, I recommend you buy Coolpad Cool 1 and not Zuk Z2 Plus.SCREEN RATING :: 9.5/10___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________(iii) DESIGNING OF SOFTWARE AND PHONE---} I personally do not like the plane design of the Zuk Z2 Plus. In terms of design, Lenovo is not that great as can be seen from the designs of Moto series smartphones but Cool 1 design is very good and appealing than that of Zuk's. Also, I do not like the stock Android experience but that too you can change and customize by installing various themes from Google Play Store.DESIGN RATING ::LOOKS/APPEARANCE : 7.8/10SOFTWARE : 8/10___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________(iv) BATTERY, SPEAKERS AND PERFORMANCE---} This headset comes with a 3500 mAH BATTERY which can easily last 1 DAY if you are a HEAVY USER and Net Surfer. For NORMAL users like me, it lasts for an average of 2 DAYS EASILY with 10% Battery STILL LEFT! With FAST CHARGING SUPPORT, battery is not a problem anymore!--} It comes with a USB Type-C PORT which is NOT A PROBLEM BUT AN ADVANTAGE as the FUTURE OF CHARGING GADGETS IS USB Type-C! Come On!--} The SPEAKERS are NOT that great in bass but are CLEAR and LOUD. It has 3.5 mm JACK too so DO NOT feel your OLD WIRED EARPHONES are of no use now. EARPHONES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE BOX.--} PERFORMANCE WISE, the phone NEVER HANGED OR LAGGED in my DAILY USAGE and HARDCORE MULTI TASKING and switching between HEAVY GAMES and APPS was just a PIECE OF CAKE for the processor! I ASSURE you that performance will not be a problem in future as the combination of CPU(Snapdragon 820) and RAM(4 GB DDR4) is more than enough to handle all that extra pressure.--} It also has a VERY FAST Finger Print Unlocking. You CANNOT INSERT A microSD card to expand the storage of this smartphone but it comes with 64GB internal storage which is sufficient for 99% of the users.BATTERY RATING :: 9/10SPEAKER RATING :: 7/10PERFORMANCE RATING :: 10/10___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________(v) UNIQUENESS---} This mobile has the top Snapdragon 820 processor with DDR4 4GB RAM and 4K recording at Rs.14999. This is itself a VERY UNIQUE deal!UNIQUENESS RATING :: 9/10__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________B) DEAL MAKER ::  a) 13MP PRIMARY and SECONDARY Cameras  b) 4K Video Recording  c) Fast Charging  d) 4 GB DDR4 RAM  e) Gorilla Glass 3 ProtectionC) DEAL BREAKER ::  a) No expandable storage which might be a Deal Breaker for some as many of the users have their data in their memory cards of previous phones and transferring all that data requires quite a bit of time.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________D) CONCLUSION ::In MY OPINION, after thorough usage and testing, I THINK you should go with Coolpad Cool 1 and NOT with Zuk Z2 Plus. Coolpad Cool 1 is till date, the BEST SMARTPHONE you can buy under Rs.15000 as it is a complete package with a very good processor too. BUT, if you are more concern of the Lenovo's Branding and just want a Snapdragon 820 processor and accept the fact that it has a 5 inch screen, then you can buy Zuk Z2 Plus.In terms of AFTER SALES SERVICE, Samsung, Apple, One-Plus,etc., are the best and you will not face any issue from their side.FINAL RATING :: 8.8/10And, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND PATIENCE. I really mean it and appreciate it. If you have any questions regarding this device, FEEL FREE to COMMENT by clicking on comment button below and I will surely answer all your queries as soon as I see them.

Anyway since I got this in 10000 so mind took over.(2000 amazon cashback, 8000 on exchange).So lets talk about cons most irritating to lesser ones:1. No native audio/video player, or gallery. No FM... F-U lenovo.2. Flash light is of very very bad quality. Actually camera is not bad under low light but the intensity of its flash is the issue. Its so dull that you dont see any difference while turning it on under normal slightly dim light. Even le-eco le 2 and redmi note 3 had triple or more intensity than this flash light.This is the reason it gives dull photos at night. No quality of material was checked by lenovo. F-U again.3. Volte doesnt work. Everytime volte signal goes down completely from your handset,you need to reset the phone to get them back. It happens if you are moving from Metro city to non metro city for a day or two and whoosh. Volte is gone.Keep rebooting the phone but it wont help. Called customer care and they said the same. Do the reset. Now changed the sim and volte is showing up. Dont know for how long it will be there.4. Chat,whatsapp new message notifications will come only in notification center and doesn't show up on app icon. In notification center also you dont get to see who messaged you. Just shows the number of messages.5. Doesnt connect flawlessly to my smart tv via wireless display or for the fact you cant do much with the phone to connect and share on tv.6. Screen went black 4-5 times in a day continuously for a week and I had to wait for good 5-10 minutes then press shut down button for sometime to get the phone restarted. Rarely happened after the update.7. You cant set any of your photos as background theme.8.No call record function.Now Pros:1. No overheating all the time as said by other reviewers.2. No lagging issues or memory ram etc issues. IN fact it is the most sophisticated in handling upto 55 apps as I checked without closing any background app or hanging or slowing down while switching.3. camera is ok,however you get time-lapse feature which is just awesome and not on any other flagship as far as I know.4. Got the 3.5 mm jack too.5. Audio speaker is good and will do with most of your requirements.6. light and small phone. Better than 5.5' , 6' phones for day to day use.7. gaming experience is far better than  xiaomi,samsung,leeco,motorola g4 plus etc. Doesnt heat while gaming for 30-40 minutes. Never tried more than that btw.8. \"U-touch\" this is the ultimate USP of this phone. Its a breeze to use. It kicks ass of any iphone. YOu can do a lot of things with it.9. Install as many apps/media as you want and you still have enough memory in spare.10. And yes it has the fast charging.

According to specifications it could easily hold the price of 15k.So Obivisouly in this price range (11k) it is best option. Its blasting specifications are its upside..Coming to the down side of device.. there are many things which you will expect from device based on its specification chart, but actually missing..1. Camera : the camera specifications seems to be good but does not give that much quality.. photos are natural and whitish.. i.e. lacks in beautification adjustment of image. Further in low light camera lacks in capturing good images.. so in camera department its just like OK... but still good in this price segment (11k).2. Performance : I don't know why with these configurations as well, we sometimes see some very short (0.1-0.3 s) lags, which definitly question the smoothness of device. It seems like device try to response as quickly as possible but just get confused for a moment... i think its because of its fast input receiving property or something little bad communications in software.. possibly as from other reviews it seems to be due to slower ROM in system which can be improved by installing custom ROMs (this may effect the warranty).. But anyways for an average user its stock UI is still good compare to other device of this price segment.3. Screen and build quality (Pros) : Device is made up of so called fiber (may be carbon fiber). which actually makes this device very light compared to its dimentions and battery pack up. Back side is covered up by glass (not gorilla) which add the stylish nature. Overall build quality of device is GOOD.  Coming to screen, its Full HD 441ppi LTPS LCD display which is good and noise free, The screen brightness are good and you can see it in direct sunlight without trouble. Although it has adaptive brightness (like auto brightness in which you can also adjust the brightness manually) , BUT IT IS NOT THAT MUCH GREAT. so many times you may have to adjust brightness4. Fingerprint : Till now its good, although its speed is not upto that mark. Earlier it was so responsive but i think with time it will take average time of 0.5s to unlock the phone. (may be due to little bad ROM)5. Battery(pros) : It has 3500mA battery, which is quite good and lasts for full day easily. The charger supplied is normal 2A charger and charges the device in aproxx 130-150 Minuts. The device support fast charging but i will recommend to use the charger which is provided in box, as fast charging may heat up your phone quite more then usual.So overall the phone is nice and budget friendly... so you can go for it...things which you may have to compromise are1. Non metallic body (That actually makes device heavier, and its body is much tougher then aluminium)2. Little smaller 5 inch screen (5.5 inch screen might not be comfortable for every user, I personally like 5 inch Phone because it is easier to use with one hand)3.

I came to know that camera is actually very good in natural lighting condition and shoot nicely and and focus the object very fast. I agree with low lighting conditions it struggles a bit but I would suggest buy selfie flash . I am planning to buy that one and get back to you again. But from 17500 rs what will you expect. One of the best part is Its U touch which is amazing. Act as fingerprint sensor too. Gaming exp is nice although I don't play too much games.

External sound is slightly less than other phone but I can hear incoming calling very loudly. No issues. Thanks to Lenovo who incorporated Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip.

I used the phone without case just for a few hours and I got scratches in it.- Unknow glass protection at the front(no gorilla glass)- Power button is placed below volume rocker which is a bummer on my view, Still I can   t  get used to it.- Good screen quality but lacks AMOLED panel.Cellular reception & Sound quality+ Good cellular reception.+ Has VOLTE support in SIM 1, so you can use JIO Sim for calls without using app.-When you turn on VOLTE you need to reboot the phone to get it enabled.- No inbuilt Call recording option which is a very basic one, sadly you have to download third party app from playstore for call recording.- Sound quality via headphone jack is very less audible and flat.-Sound quality via speakers is ok but not good enough.CameraLenovo doesn   t have a good history for camera and it continues here too.+13 MP rear camera does very good in natural lighting.+8MP front camera is good and I have no complaints.+4K video recording is good-Lacks OIS and laser autofocus so need to be careful on taking shots otherwise photos will come blurry.-Lots of noise and bad quality images  in low lighting.- F2.2 aperture which is not good for closeup shots and macro shots.-Single LED flashGeneral Performance+Qualcomm 820+Good memory management, keeps all open apps in memory+No lags till now.-Phone gets heats up on the follwing occasions which is annoying  1.

On road, even full brightness makes the phone barely visible.  The only saving grace is it's processor/RAM, which too , however, do not offer a smooth experience thst you would expect.

The installation was smooth charged very fast to full. Now my first thoughts:1) Slim and much lighter than the Lenovo P1 I had but the screen looks smaller because the BACK and MENU button are on the screen. This can be an advantage if the phone hangs as you might have an issue closing the app as these buttons get screwed up. Also, on mplayer I noticed that it caused interference with quick seek function when orientation changed as you have to swipe up to get the back/menu buttons visible which is the same gesture for seek in mplayer.2) Jio worked out of the box and calls and data does not require any reliance app installation but stopped working in a month.3) Out of the box has matt finish screen guard fixed on it. No more fixing menaces.4) Has a soft semi-transparent flexible silicon cover for the phone free in the box and is a good one.5) Smooth operation.6) Storage memory cannot be extended and no sd card support7) Single speaker and not as loud and effective as Lenovo P1 Dolby Atmos. When I paired amkette headphones it worked ok.8) Nano sims go through the side and there is no cover to be opened which is neat.9) I miss the tiny slide button on the side of Lenovo P1 used to switch the phone to power saver mode.10) Options in the system are less but looks less complex than in Lenovo P1.11) There was built in ftp in P1 file manager which is missing here. so if you want wireless file manager you have to install 3rd party app.12) Rear camera is better than P1 in low light conditions though not as good as professional ones but I think its reasonable. i did not test front camera.13) The android back button is on the left and switch/menu is on the right.

Unless the Rs. 2,000 price difference is absolutely unmanageable for you, we would definitely recommend you go for the 4GB/64GB variant, since the phone does not have expandable storage and you might find yourself falling short of space at some point in the future.\nApart from these basic specifications, the phone also supports Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac connectivity, Bluetooth 4.1 with A2DP, and USB 2.0 with a Type-C connector for charging and data transfers. The charger included in the box is an ordinary 10W unit rather than a Fast Charge 3.0 capable charger, which is a bit of a disappointment. Although the phone isn't very slow to charge, you can't make use of the ability to grab a quick top-up unless you buy another aftermarket charger.\n\nLenovo Z2 Plus software\nWhile the Zuk Z1 was powered by CyanogenOS, the Z2 Plus uses a custom-built user interface called ZUI, which is essentially the familiar Google Now launcher but with some customisations from the Zuk software development team. Certain aspects of the interface, such as the home screens, widgets, and app drawer are stock Google, while Zuk's customisations show in the notification shade, home button, and quick settings menu. Additionally, the Settings app is laid out differently from what we're used to seeing on devices that use stock or near-stock Android.\nThe interface and software don't quite give you the same level of customisability that Cyanogen OS offers, but it is fairly conducive to tweaking nonetheless. The Zuk customisations can be controlled through the Settings app, and give you a decent amount of control over the device. However, there is a slight lack of polish to the interface, with some silly grammar and spelling errors showing up in a few places. Strangely, we also found settings for the camera in the Settings app, but there is a way to get to them from within the camera app as well.\nThe Z2 Plus runs on Android 6.0.1, and with the Zuk team taking the lead on software development, we hope to see timely software updates and security patches. Although there is no firm timeline on when the device will receive Android 7.0, it can be expected.\n\nLenovo Z2 Plus camera\nThe Lenovo Z2 Plus has a 13-megapixel primary camera with single-tone LED flash, and an 8-megapixel front camera. The rear camera can record video at up to 4K, while the front camera is capable of 1080p.\nThe camera app has all the usual modes, including panorama, time lapse, and slow-motion video, as well as basic filters and a icon for the detailed settings which can also be found in the main Settings app. There are also quick shortcuts for the video mode, camera switcher, flash, HDR mode, and the gallery. The settings menu will let you control the resolution, slow-motion frame rate, and a few other useful settings. Notably, slow-motion frame rate has three options including a rather phenomenal-sounding 960fps mode.\n\nTap to see full-sized Lenovo Z2 Plus camera sample\n\nTap to see full-sized Lenovo Z2 Plus camera sample\nGoing straight into the details of the audacious 960fps mode, it turns out that it's just a bit of post-processing trickery involving slowing down the clip on the device itself. The actual framerate is 120fps, and the resolution is capped at 720p. The phone simply slows down playback to give the impression of a high frame rate. Videos shot at the supposed 960fps or even 240fps are not true slow-motion, and lag is visible between frames. You're really better off shooting at 120fps, and that's something that most phones offer these days, so the Z2 Plus doesn't have any advantage here.\nThere is however the ability to shoot ordinary video at a resolution of up to 2160p, which will result in sharper, more detailed clips. However, shooting at this resolution causes a bit of heat and drains the battery rather quickly, apart from generating massive files. Video is decent enough at 1080p as well.\n\nTap to see full-sized Lenovo Z2 Plus camera sample\nStill photography is a bit of a disappointment with the Lenovo Z2 Plus. Although photos aren't bad, they certainly do not live up to flagship expectations, with the camera performing on par with a typical mid-range device. Colours are dull, there is grain in dark areas, and bright zones in low-light areas end up looking oversaturated. It's difficult to take pictures that really pop in conditions that aren't well lit. The camera of the Z2 Plus is good enough for occasional photography, but if you're camera-happy and like to take a lot of pictures, this isn't the best phone for you.\n\nTap to see full-sized Lenovo Z2 Plus camera sample\nLenovo Z2 Plus performance\nThe Lenovo Z2 Plus' performance is expectedly good, thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC. Our review unit was the 4GB RAM variant which is more than enough at this point, but there is a 3GB RAM variant available for less which should perform very nearly as capably. Whether you're playing games or jumping between lots of apps open at the same time, the 4GB variant breezes through without any lag or stutter. This is helped by software that is generally efficient. However, there are some slight heat issues, particularly when playing graphically intensive games, and this also leads to quicker-than-usual battery drain.\nWe ran the phone through our usual suite of benchmarks, and results were on par with what we'd expect from a top-end smartphone with a Snapdragon 820 SoC. AnTuTu produced a score of 129,217, while Quadrant returned a score of 38,482. The phone also performed brilliantly in the graphical benchmark tests, maxing out both 3D Mark Ice Storm Extreme and GFXBench. The phone didn't have any issues running high-resolution video either.\nThe Lenovo Z2 Plus ran for 16 hours, 40 minutes in our video loop test, and would last well over a day in ordinary use as well, which is excellent despite the power under the hood. Wi-Fi, cellular connectivity, and voice quality on calls are all decent, although the phone's speaker isn't quite up to the mark and produces sound that is a bit tinny.\n\nVerdict\nAfter the saturation of the budget and mid-range segments for mobile phones, manufacturers have now moved on to offering high-end hardware at decidedly mid-range prices. With its premium specifications and high-quality build, the Lenovo Z2 Plus is a proper powerhouse of a smartphone that can hold its own against any flagship device when it comes to performance.\nWhile the Lenovo Z2 Plus may not necessarily the most appealing flagship, its greatest advantage over the competition is its cost. Starting at Rs. 17,999, the phone offers top quality at a very reasonable price, and even the more expensive Rs. 19,999 variant is more affordable than any other similarly specified smartphone. This is what makes the phone easy to recommend. The Lenovo Z2 Plus offers flagship performance and quality at a mid-range price, and makes a lot of sense for anyone from casual to power users - unless camera quality is extremely important to you.", "0 users found this review helpful", "3 stars", "13 Nov 2016,"], ["Few days a go i was purchase Lenovo Z2 Plus black 64GB  then phone was dead Plz dont buy this phone", "0 users found this review helpful", "1 stars", "13 Nov 2016,"], ["Ordered it on launch and have been using it for 2 days now. So far it's been a brilliant experience. Thanks Amazon for the quick delivery.Pros:1. Simple design - love the glossy back2. Fast efficient and great for multi tasking3. U touch is the best solution to one handed users and to those who multi task a lot - the fingerprint scanner is fast and accurate and yes works with wet hands too!4. It lasted a whole day without the battery draining out - with medium to high usage. And no major heating issues.5. Call quality is great and the noise cancellation tech helps greatly6. The speaker is loud and clear though being located at the bottom may trouble a few.7. It has all the sensors required for AR gaming and also has a led notification light.8. Near stock Android experience with little bloatware.Cons.1. Camera is great for bright lighting but is only above average in low lighting2. The glossy back which I love is a finger print magnet - I prefer to keep the case on at all times.3. The speaker jack is located at the bottom -works nicely though4. Didn't care much about the u health app as I already have a fitness tracker on my wrist. But the app is fairly accurate when I compare it to the stats on my tracker.5. No corning gorilla glass - instead it's some sort of hardened glass which worked on my previous Lenovo phone too6. The case in the box is good and sturdy but slightly rough on the back. The matte screen protector that was pre applied had tiny air bubbles - so I will be replacing that. No headphones in the box.7. No FM radio but the 64gb space takes care of this8. It's not Qualcomm turbo charge as was quoted by some media before. Also, there is no cable provided for the quick charge and it's not a device on the Qualcomm website as well.All this at a price point of 20k - quite the value for money.A definite buy.", "0 users found this review helpful", "4 stars", "13 Nov 2016,"], ["I am coming from Nexus 5 with latest custom Nougat ROM... bought this phone after checking its capabilities as a developer phone...I will unlock bootloader and flash custom ROMs after using it as it is for some time..software side is very clean with minimum number of apps installed.. this is very likable approach..some of the small tweaks which I found show that team ZUK has created this device with love and care....", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "13 Nov 2016,"], ["Within one week of purchase, I am facing hanging of the phone frequently.

Feel very light in hand as compared to its look.\n2. no heating issue issue at all. I am not a heavy gamer\n3. I like it's screen size. Not a fan of 5.5 inches\n4.no lags so far. 4gb ram with snapdragon 820 is working wonders.\n5. ZUK's minimal customizations on top of Android is very thoughtful and much on my liking. Not a fan of pure Android exp like in Nexus devices.\n6. Mobile screen is good. I am not missing super AMOLED. This screen is good enough.\n7. Camera is decent. Purchase DSLR is you are expecting wonders from your mobile camera. under 30000 no mobile gives DSLR quality.\n8. I have got 64gb white variant after exchanging my 2 yrs old Xiaomi mi4.

Not feeling like having a new phone. It's resembles iPhone mi4 and many other phone.\n2. Lenovo should have provided a quick charger instead of regular charger. This regular charger is not very bad. It is 2.5amp charger. But it will take up to 2 hours to fully charge this device.\n3. Glass back is finger print magnet. Will always have to use a case.

Will post about the same once tech visit is done.Other issues i observed in 3 days with the fone-1) Heating - 1 hour of usage is leading to massive heating of the phone. To this the amazon agent replied that anything below 48 degrees is acceptable. Phone heats up to an extent where you need to keep it aside for 30 mins to cool down.2) The proximity sensor is poor.3) Auto time out doesnt work all the time.

ITS JUST AVERAGE\n\n===================================================================================================\n\nPROS\n\n1. First is the 2.15 GHz Quad-core Snapdragon 820 processor.\n\n2. Second is the Adreno 530 GPU for gaming performance.\n\n3. RAM has 4 GB and its a DDR4.\n\n4. Another advantages or pros is that it comes with 64 GB of internal memory.\n\n5. VoLTE is supported and so the Reliance Jio 4G internet service as well.\n\n6. The 13 camera sensor can record videos in 4K resolution.\n\n7. Clean Android Marshmallow v6.0.1 and on top of that a simple ZUI 2.0 user interface is stuffed.\n\n8. The fingerprint scanner takes less than 0.2 seconds to unlock which is quite fast. Also it can unlock the device with wet fingers too.\n\n9. Next Lenovo Z2 Plus advantages or pros is that the home button is a U-Touch 2.0 which has seven different functions for navigation.\nA Far Better Alternative Smartphone\n\n10. The smartphone acts as a fitness tracker with its inbuilt U-Health app.\n\n11. Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is present for the protection of its display.\n\n12. USB Type-C reversible connector is present for charging and data syncing.\n\n13. Another Lenovo Z2 Plus advantages is that USB OTG cable is also supported.\n\n14. It comes with a massive 3500 mAh battery that can provide juice for more than a day.\n\n15. For fast charging the battery Quick Charge 3.0 is present which can charge the device up to 83%  in just 30 minutes.\n\n16. All the essential sensors are present. They are gyroscope, eCompass (magnetometer), accelerometer, ambient light sensor (for adaptive brightness), hall sensor (proximity sensor) and distance sensor (pedometer).\n\n17. The body has metal on its edges and Corning Gorilla Glass 3 with anti-oil and anti-fingerprint magnet coating on the front and back panel.\n\n==================================================================================================\n\nCONS\n\n1. For this price tag the 5 inch screen is definitely a very small display for both media consumption and as a smartphone in general.\n\n2. Next Lenovo Z2 Plus cons or demerits is that the contrast ratio of the full HD display is lower than 900:1 which is means the black are not too black to distinguish from grey. In case if you are looking for a 2K display smartphone at around the same price tag then follow this link.\n\n3. There is no memory card slot. If you buy the 64 GB it is OK but the 32 GB model is a huge compromise for internal memory.\n\n4. The phone is a bit on the thicker side at 8.5 mm, currently the average smartphone have a thickness between 7.5 to 7.8\n\n5. Other than the home button there in no dedicated navigational touch buttons below the screen. All are placed on the already small size screen.\n\n6. Another Lenovo Z2 Plus cons or drawbacks is that the 13 megapixel primary camera is a huge letdown with a smaller f/2.2 focal aperture.\n\n7. Lenovo says that its has EIS (electronic image stabilization), but the truth is that EIS is available with almost all smartphones phones and it doesn   t help much in stabilization. The real important missing part with the camera is the OIS (optical image stabilization) feature.\n\n8. There is also no infrared for IR blaster which could have been used for wireless control of TV, AC and other home appliances.\n\n9.

It is snappy, doesn't hangs, keeps the applications in memory for multitasking.\nI am not a great fan of skinned UIs but I don't mind using the ZUI with NOVA launcher or any other launcher. U touch is great. Only thing I don't like in ZUI is that the status bar doesn't allow notifications expansion.\nI don't use camera so I won't be able to provide any insight on it.\n\nWhen I wanted to buy the phone, the points I had in mind were:\n1. 5 inch screen or less (check)\n2. Snapdragon processor >= Snapdragon 650 (check)\n3. Dual Sim (check)\n4. 3GB ram or greater (check)\n4. MicroSd card slot (partially check - 64 GB variant is fine for me)\n5. Decent battery life (check)\n6. Should not heat while browsing (check - I browse internet with 16-17 tabs open in chrome and my previous phone use to heat up like anything)\n7. Open kernel source code which helps in developing custom roms (check - I am not a rom developer)\n\nIf lenovo could have taken care of below points as well then this phone could have been a really great phone. May be they could have increased the price a bit more say Rs. 21000 or Rs. 22000.\n\n1. Instead of flat sides curved side like redmi 3s could have made it easier for me to hold the phone really comfortably.\n2. MicroSd Card Slot\n3. IR Blaster\n4. Near stock android like one plus 3's Oxygen OS.\n\nI will be rooting my phone soon to try xposed modules and if the cyanogenmod becomes stable for it then will be flashing that too.\n\nLastly I will only say its a really good phone.

To name a few are 1) Prevent pocket dials, 2) Notification permission control for individual app, 3) Show battery percentage in status bar and many more\n11) Fingerprint is quite responsive and accurate, not the best response all the time (Can store up to 5 fingerprint)\n12) The Quick Switch Panel is simply amazing; it makes sense to put all those action at the bottom of the screen rather than in notification panel (Though it   s an iPhone copy actually)\n13) Front camera is very good. Good to take selfies and video chats.\n\nCons-\n1) LED notification is almost useless, you will have to struggle to actually see it.\n2) There is no extended notification, also you cannot directly take action from the notification menu.\n3) No option to disable heads up notification as in Samsung and other phones (Though there are third party apps to disable it).\n4) Glass in front are back are not corning gorilla glass, and yes it easily gets scratched up.\n5) Many user   s complaints of its random restart during normal usage and during calls, well in my 10 days    usage it did restart once during a call, never after that this happened to me.\n6) Heats up after heavy gaming of more than 15 mins (But to be honest most phone do heat up during heavy gaming). One good thing is, since the phone is not made up of metal it cools down very quickly.\n7) Rear camera is just average. Don   t keep your expectation high. (Don   t get me wrong it   s not bad at all)\n8) I expected more from a 3500 mah battery (Personal opinion)\n9) I have noticed a bug on this phone, the scrolling is not very smooth on this. Also while using Facebook swiping photos left or right is a pain in the ass. Definitely a software patch will sort this thing out.\n10) You will struggle using this mobile under direct sunlight.\n\nCamera review-\nFront camera- Good for selfies and video chat, can record HD videos\nRear camera- Average performance, phone struggles in artificial lights. Great to use in natural lighting\n\nGaming review-\nCan play all the heavy games you can think of without any lag.

Since I   ve switched from Moto E to this phone, many of my friends has noticed a positive change in the voice quality they are hearing.\n\nPerformance review-\nSD 820 chipset with 4GB Ram, do I need to say more. It handles all apps very well. Great memory management with this phone. Most of the apps are in the memory so no loading of apps again and again.\n\nPhone build quality-\nLight weight for a 3500 mah battery. It   s an iPhone in looks. Front and back glass is not from corning. It gets easily scratched up and it   s a finger magnet.\n\nBattery performance-\nCan easily last a whole working day with heavy usage. Charging time 2 hours approx. from 0-100%. Also it comes with an intelligent charge cut (ICC)\n\nSound review-\nDecent output from loudspeaker and headphones.\n\nPS.- Amazon your service was really bad. Took a whole week to get the phone.

So when a very lazy individual like myself does go ahead and review a product, I suggest you do at least glance through it.The Lenovo Z2+ is definitely a next generation phone bundled with all the goodies U require & desire at literally a rock bottom price. I am not going to get into the specifications as that's already provided in the description. What I will tell U are the shortfalls that would've made this phone the ULTIMATE FLAGSHIP KILLER:1. No I/R (Infrared) blaster to control your electronic gadgets like your Idiot Box (TV)2. No expandable storage (even 64GB will seem less in about 8 months)3. No NFC (not a major drawback right now, but guessing where the future is headed, it maybe a larger concern)4. The Camera doesn't do justice (this would be a major downer for someone who has an SLR, but in all honesty if U did have an SLR, U don't need Ur phone to become one ;)  I personally was satisfied with the Camera as it does what it's supposed to, but I guess the software isn't capable of harnessing the full potential of the Camera hardware, guessing it should be fixed in the near future with a PROPER software update! The initial software update for the Camera which U install after booting for the first time doesn't do Jack about improving the Camera :(5. Last but not the least, you don't receive headset/headphones with your device. Honesty Lenovo this is total KANJOOS-GIRI... Even though I would only use them maybe once in 3 years, I expect it to be a part of my SMART-phone packaging!If the above shortcomings don't affect you, then please do go ahead and buy this device as the Hardware is a beast and the Software for the first time feels like (fluid and lagfree) it is a worthy challenger to the almighty iOS.This device won't disappoint you any further than the disappointments I mentioned above. Trust me, this is the phone of 2016, not OnePlus3 (which is no longer at the price point it should be well within!)If you want the BOMB of an experience, I suggest you go for the 64GB Variant with 4Gigs of DDR4 RAM and please go for the Jet Black, it's truly gorgeous!!Amazon was spontaneous with the delivery and kudos for being early! This wouldn't be possible without a thank U to Lenovo for setting a low price trend for a phone worthy of FLAGSHIP performance (sorry for the bashing initially Lenovo, Peace Out :PAnd to sum this all up, I was lazily able to type this review from my gorgeous Lenovo Z2+P.S. I managed to successfully drop my phone thrice from a decent height with the device landing on the screen every time and trust me, not even a blemish. The screen is quite strong but I personally suggest you buy a plastic/rubber Screen Guard (not Tempered Glass cause it doesn't absorb the impact but sends the shockwaves right through to the touchscreen beneath, which destroyed my friend's iPhone6+) also buy a solid case that covers the phone completely with a front lip to protect the screen and also do get yourself at least 2 years insurance, I personally recommend Times Global Insurance, that way U can live tension free!", "0 users found this review helpful", "4 stars", "31 Oct 2016,"], ["Camera quality is poor for a 20K phone.

Although the Snapdragon 821 is now the company's flagship, the 820 remains a powerful and capable SoC, and the Z2 Plus certainly benefits from it.The Lenovo Z2 Plus is available in two variants. The more affordable Rs. 17,999 version has 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, while the Rs. 19,999 one has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. Unless the Rs. 2,000 price difference is absolutely unmanageable for you, we would definitely recommend you go for the 4GB/64GB variant since the phone does not have expandable storage and you might find yourself falling short of space at some point in the future.Apart from these basic specifications, the phone also supports Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/as connectivity, Bluetooth 4.1 with A2DP, and USB 2.0 with a Type-C connector for charging and data transfers. The charger included in the box is an ordinary 10W unit rather than a Fast Charge 3.0 capable charger, which is a bit of a disappointment. Although the phone isn't very slow to charge, you can't make use of the ability to grab a quick top-up unless you buy another aftermarket charger.Lenovo Z2 Plus softwareWhile the Zuk Z1 was powered by CyanogenOS, the Z2 Plus uses a custom-built user interface called ZUI, which is essentially the familiar Google Now launcher but with some customizations from the Zuk software development team. Certain aspects of the interface, such as the home screens, widgets, and app drawer are stock Google, while Zuk's customizations show in the notification shade, home button, and quick settings menu. Additionally, the Settings app is laid out differently from what we're used to seeing on devices that use stock or near-stock Android.The interface and software don't quite give you the same level of customizability that Cyanogen OS offers, but it is fairly conducive to tweaking nonetheless. The Zuk customizations can be controlled through the Settings app, and give you a decent amount of control over the device. However, there is a slight lack of polish to the interface, with some silly grammar and spelling errors showing up in a few places. Strangely, we also found settings for the camera in the Settings app, but there is a way to get to them from within the camera app as well.The Z2 Plus runs on Android 6.0.1, and with the Zuk team taking the lead on software development, we hope to see timely software updates and security patches. Although there is no firm timeline on when the device will receive Android 7.0, it can be expected.Lenovo Z2 Plus cameraThe Lenovo Z2 Plus has a 13-megapixel primary camera with single-tone LED flash and an 8-megapixel front camera. The rear camera can record video at up to 4K, while the front camera is capable of 1080p.The camera app has all the usual modes, including panorama, time-lapse, and slow-motion video, as well as basic filters and an icon for the detailed settings which can also be found in the main Settings app. There are also quick shortcuts for the video mode, camera switcher, flash, HDR mode, and the gallery. The settings menu will let you control the resolution, slow-motion frame rate, and a few other useful settings. Notably, the slow-motion frame rate has three options including a rather phenomenal-sounding 960fps mode.Going straight into the details of the audacious 960fps mode, it turns out that it's just a bit of post-processing trickery involving slowing down the clip on the device itself. The actual frame rate is 120fps, and the resolution is capped at 720p. The phone simply slows down playback to give the impression of a high frame rate. Videos shot at the supposed 960fps or even 240fps are not true slow-motion, and lag is visible between frames. You're really better off shooting at 120fps, and that's something that most phones offer these days, so the Z2 Plus doesn't have any advantage here.There is, however, the ability to shoot ordinary video at a resolution of up to 2160p, which will result in sharper, more detailed clips. However, shooting at this resolution causes a bit of heat and drains the battery rather quickly, apart from generating massive files. The video is decent enough at 1080p as well.Still, photography is a bit of a disappointment with the Lenovo Z2 Plus. Although photos aren't bad, they certainly do not live up to flagship expectations, with the camera performing on par with a typical mid-range device. Colors are dull, there is grain in dark areas, and bright zones in low-light areas end up looking oversaturated. It's difficult to take pictures that really pop in conditions that aren't well lit. The camera of the Z2 Plus is good enough for occasional photography, but if you're camera-happy and like to take a lot of pictures, this isn't the best phone for you.Lenovo Z2 Plus performanceThe Lenovo Z2 Plus' performance is expectedly good, thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 SoC. Our review unit was the 4GB RAM variant which is more than enough at this point, but there is a 3GB RAM variant available for less which should perform very nearly as capable. Whether you're playing games or jumping between lots of apps open at the same time, the 4GB variant breezes through without any lag or stutter. This is helped by software that is generally efficient. However, there are some slight heat issues, particularly when playing graphically intensive games, and this also leads to quicker-than-usual battery drain.We ran the phone through our usual suite of benchmarks, and results were on par with what we'd expect from a top-end smartphone with a Snapdragon 820 SoC. AnTuTu produced a score of 129,217, while Quadrant returned a score of 38,482. The phone also performed brilliantly in the graphical benchmark tests, maxing out both 3D Mark Ice Storm Extreme and GFXBench. The phone didn't have any issues running high-resolution video either.The Lenovo Z2 Plus ran for 16 hours, 40 minutes in our video loop test, and would last well over a day in ordinary use as well, which is excellent despite the power under the hood. Wi-Fi, cellular connectivity, and voice quality on calls are all decent, although the phone's speaker isn't quite up to the mark and produces the sound that is a bit tinny.VerdictAfter the saturation of the budget and mid-range segments for mobile phones, manufacturers have now moved on to offering high-end hardware at decidedly mid-range prices. With its premium specifications and high-quality build, the Lenovo Z2 Plus is a proper powerhouse of a smartphone that can hold its own against any flagship device when it comes to performance.While the Lenovo Z2 Plus may not necessarily the most appealing flagship, its greatest advantage over the competition is its cost. Starting at Rs. 17,999, the phone offers top quality at a very reasonable price, and even the more expensive Rs. 19,999 variant is more affordable than any other similarly specified smartphone. This is what makes the phone easy to recommend. The Lenovo Z2 Plus offers flagship performance and quality at a mid-range price and makes a lot of sense for anyone from casual to power users - unless camera quality is extremely important to you.", "0 users found this review helpful", "4 stars", "31 Oct 2016,"], ["Go for the Moto Z Play or Oneplus 3 if you can afford the extra 5-8K.

This type of cost cutting is quite frankly annoying. Everyone seems to brush it off by saying 'oh but it's only 20K' but I'd rather have paid the extra amount. Added to that, ZUI is quite frankly a pretty poor skin.

While there are tens of reviews with number of viewpoints already on this phone (and the chinese variant Zuk Z2), I feel that I can add some points that many people have missed and help future buyers make more informed decisions.\n\nI made a budget of upto Rs.25k to buy a new phone and narrowed it down to the following phones simply based on the specs and the price range: \"Lenovo Z2 Plus\" (this model), \"ZTE Axon 7 mini\" (not yet released as of this writing), \"OnePlus 3\", \"Honor 8\". I had \"Moto G4 Plus\" as well at one point, and it was one of my favorites but after I learned that it doesn't have a compass and that there are issues with navigation and taking photospheres, I decided to drop it. I finally decided on Z2 Plus as I thought it is a great value for the money, and worth taking any compromises that might come with it.\n\nHardware: 4 out 5 stars\nSoftware: 3 out 5 stars\nOverall: 3.5 out 5 stars (which incidentally is where the average rating is on Amazon, but since there is no way to pick 3.5, I would rather pick 3 instead of 4).\n\nI am summarizing my feedback into 4 categories, +ves and -ves separately on hardware and software.\n\nHardware +ves:\n\n- 5\" form factor. I was replacing LG G2 with a 5.2\" screen (but has a 5\" form factor) and wanted to stick to the smaller size as much as possible. I also use an iPhone 6 Plus (due to work) and don't find the larger size appealing.\n- Performance is top notch. Note that the Lenovo took some cuts that impacts the performance of the onboard storage, but this doesn't translate to any obvious performance issues for the user.\n- Fingerprint sensor is very accurate and fast. It is actually so sensitive that I disabled certain gestures (e.g., power on and unlock from sleep) to reduce accidental operations.\n- Display is good and readable in direct sunlight (enough to find a contact and make calls). The auto-brightness also works well and adjusts the brightness quickly.\n- Battery life is great. I am getting at least 6hrs of screen on time. I don't however play games, but do use quite a lot of apps that include news, communication, bank, security apps.\n- Built-in sensor co-processor (Hexagon 680 DSP) makes it possible to track your activity the entire day without much impact on the battery life. I had been considering to buy a fitness band, but now I don't think I need one, as my phone is mostly in my pocket anyway. I find the bundled app UHealth to be inaccurate (estimates always on the higher side). I am using Google fit instead. Both UHealth and Google Fit were consuming about 0.5% of battery life, which is negligible for the whole day tracking they provide.\n- The charger build quality seems to be pretty good. The charger fits tightly into the sockets, unlike a few other chargers (including iphone 6) that I have. The cable also looks to be good quality, so may not have to worry about fraying (again, unlike iphone cable). However, because this is just a non-turbo 2A charger, I might have to replace it anyway.\n- Google photos works great with the camera and gyroscope to capture nice photospheres.\n- Compass seems to be accurate and works well with the new Google Maps feature to show the orientation accuracy.\n- SIM cards can be replaced without shutting down the phone.\n- For some reason the 2nd SIM slot can't be used for SD card, unlike most phones in this price range. I already compromised on the internal memory that it comes with, but it would have been nice to know that I could extend it when needed. I read that it supports OTG, so probably it is not all that bad in case of an emergency situation when you are seriously out of space.\n\nHardware -ves:\n\n- Look and feel is a boring brick/candybar design. Lacks character and distinguishability. I have a black one and the front reminds me too much of a black iPhone 5, which makes it even more boring for me. All this won't be a big negative except for the fact that I find it extremely uncomfortable to hold it for very long time. Right now, I have been holding it continuously with my left hand for the past 1hr reading news and now the tip of my little finger feels so numb that I have to switch hands. Using it with the provided case only makes it worse. If I remove the case, it only takes a little longer to get a numb finger, but the issue is still there as it is because of the uncomfortable sharp angles in the design.\n- No NFC, this is an unnecessary compromise.\n- Comes with a standard 5V/2A charger, not a turbo charger. This is so wrong. Even some much cheaper phones come with Turbo 3 chargers when their chipset supports it.\n- Monochromatic LED that is barely visible.\n- Speakerphone volume is not great, as it is not easy to listen to the other party unless it is quite. E.g., on my old phone I used to get away with the built-in speakerphone while driving in my car, but now I have to use BT speakerphone. Strangely though, the volume from playing videos and music is quite OK, but the max for speakerphone is lower.\n- This is not a camera phone, considering how much better the camera on other phones are (such as Moto G4 Plus and Honor 8). Camera is a mix of +ves and -ves. On one hand, it doesn't have OIS or large aperture (f/2.2 compared to f/2.0 (and even f/1.9) on cheaper phones), so having laser focus would have been good to get better focussing in low light. They did give a larger than usual sensor size (1.34   m pixel size) which should help offset. However, a cheaper Moto G4 Plus with a large sensor (1.3   m), a f/2.0 lense and both laser and phase detection autofocus will outperform this in any condition, so I am inclined to call this a -ve.\n- Vibration motor is not that strong, you can easily not notice it.\n\nSoftware +ves:\n\n- Smooth operation everywhere. No or very little lag observed while switching apps and scrolling. This is obviously expected given the chipset, but good to mention and give a clean chit.\n- Stability of the OS is great. The phone hasn't crashed so far and I haven't felt the need to restart it either.\n- No bloat that I can see. I think there were about  5 apps bundled and all of them can be uninstalled, including the original keyboard (named Vysor).\n- U-Touch is a nice touch, though I would really like to see them replaced with the default gestures that come with Android Nougat. I am somehow yet to get used to the app history navigation, but find a couple of the gestures that use physical home button useful. I have the double press to show app history, as I wanted to keep it same as on iPhone (I do use it for work and frequently switch between them). I also have the long press to make the phone sleep, but I disabled the rest of the gestures (including the one that wakes up the phone on touching the home button, as I don't like how easy it makes it to unlock the phone).\n- Nice integration of the fingerprint sensor with apps. Most apps (e.g., Keepass2droid and LastPass) are able to recognize the fingerprint sensor and offer to use that for signing into the app. I couldn't use it with Standard Chartered bank's app, but I am pretty sure that it is a fault of the app.\n- Comes with a lot of useful quick toggles.\n\nSoftware -ves:\n\n- Lockscreen customization is very limited. I haven't tried a 3rd party lock screen to see if this can be fixed.\n- Notification drawer look and feel and features are quite different from that of stock Android. You can't take actions from notifications (e.g., archive email, reply to SMS, mark a task done). You can't even expand the notifications with two finger drag. These features exist in Android since KitKat, so it is crazy that they don't exist in this firmware. Even the gesture to reach quick toggles is different.\n- Notification system seems to be in general messed up. Once you pull down the drawer, you lose all the icons in the status bar, as if you finished reading all. They are also removed from the lockscreen. This is just *ridiculous*.\n- Overall, don't expect customizations and fine tuning of options and settings, more like what you would expect on an iPhone. This wouldn't have been all that bad if they gave Marshmallow as is, but given that they removed features that have been a standard since KitKat (e.g., actions on the notifications), it feels like a major step back.\n- No battery usage timechart. I couldn't tell how much it dropped overnight in standby and how fast it charged, unless I tracked it manually.\n- No search option in settings. Coming from stock KitKat directly, I have been having hard time trying to find settings.\n- LED is only available to indicate charging, not for notifications. I tried an LED tester app and confirmed that it unavailable for the use by apps.", "0 users found this review helpful", "3 stars", "24 Oct 2016,"], ["In 15 days my phone has dead neither can be charged  nor can be on .\nNot great product by leno I.", "0 users found this review helpful", "1 stars", "24 Oct 2016,"], ["I got my Package yesterday\nIt's awesome phone guys.trust me,all the negative reviews are fake.i personally recommend you this phone if Your budget is 20000 .\nAnd only thing I don't like is\nNo earpods in Box .\n:)", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "24 Oct 2016,"], ["I got my Package yesterday\nIt's awesome phone guys.trust me,all the negative reviews are fake.i personally recommend you this phone if Your budget is 20000 .\nAnd only thing I don't like is\nNo earpods in Box .\n:)", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "24 Oct 2016,"], ["Received in excellent condition.

While that sounds cool and means it will not heat up as much as it's metal counterparts, it also makes it a fingerprint magnet.However Lenovo has thoughtfully added a protective casing with a high-class sandstone matte finish and has try to bring back the screen protector era by giving a matte screen guard stock as well.\n*The phone has a feature where post full charging of the phones battery ,the circuit is broken and the charger keeps the phone running so no more swollen batteries.\n  The 4gb ram and the afternoon 530 GPU makes it a very fluid device and helps avoid graphic lag.I am not a great fan of mobile games however I started  playing Nova 3 and Asphalt 8 and the device handles it pretty well.\n*The U touch button is the USP here.Its a very useful button that u will get trained to in about 2 days time after that it's like a one button for all magic wand.its pretty useful minimising apps moving between them and stuff like that .a fearture that I think all fingerprint readers will have pretty soon.For those who do not want to get used to don't worry there are always the on-screen buttons .\n*The phone has a dual sim 4g volte support and that's cool.\n*Body housing is fibre and yes it is pretty nice .The power and volume rockers feel sturdy and tactile.\n*The USB type C is a good feature too it makes charging and data transfer hassle free and ensures a longer life for the stock USB cable.\n*The packaging and other standard features of the phone make it worth the money .\n\nWhat I did not like about the phone:\n   At 20 k the phone stands very close to the undoubted leader in the category the One Plus 3 and it is only a very few things that makes this phone a choice .features like NFC and a sharper display would have made it future proof.\n  The camera both front and back are not up to the mark.Pics are usually shaky and the image stabilization capabilities even after a recent update arnt that great especially in artificial or low lighting conditions.I hope Lenovo fixes the issue.\n  I owned the Lenovo ZUK Z1 as well and the interface provided there that is cyanogen mod made it super cool and super customizable the ZUK UI on this Z2 however has bagged mixed reactions and is very basic as per me.No scope for customization even when it comes to wallpapers.i mean who clicks pics to fit a square pattern.Though flashing the device does not interfere in its warranty(as per popular reviews)it is still of no use to people who are not too geeky.I recommend Lenovo  ZUK initiates an optional Cyanogen mod flash at their service centers.\n  The phone comes with a snapdragon 820 choose and is quick charge 3 certified .But the stock charger is a standard 2 amp charger .it's like having a champion stallion but a novice jockey to handle it.It does take a while to charge .thanks to the 3500mah clubbed with the 5 inch display else it would have been a true letdown.\n  Again the pricing and other features makes the one plus 3 a very compelling device if you can stretch the extra 8 k .\n  Though this does not heat up like the metal counterparts there is heating at times when you have been playing heavy games for quite long .but then for non gamers it's isn't too much to worry about.\n\nIn total if camera I'd not your priority and you cannot manage to get 8K more them the Lenovo Z2 is the perfect SD 820 device for you .", "0 users found this review helpful", "4 stars", "23 Oct 2016,"], ["The phone by itself is very good.

It supports a 5 inch 1080p screen , a 13mp rear facing camera and an 8mp front camera . On the right side of the phone there are power on off button, volume rockers and SIM slots.

Let it settle down.\n* I don't understand why you people complain about the phone that, it doesn't have external memory slot, it should be 5.5 inch, it is too thick, it is too heavy, battery not removable, earphones not included...blah blah blah..

To name a few are 1) Prevent pocket dials, 2) Notification permission control for individual app, 3) Show battery percentage in status bar and many more\n11) Fingerprint is quite responsive and accurate, not the best response all the time (Can store up to 5 fingerprint)\n12)  The Quick Switch Panel is simply amazing; it makes sense to put all those action at the bottom of the screen rather than in notification panel (Though it   s an iPhone copy actually)\n13) Front camera is very good. Good to take selfies and video chats.\n\nCons-\n1) LED notification is almost useless, you will have to struggle to actually see it.\n2) There is no extended notification, also you cannot directly take action from the notification menu.\n3) No option to disable heads up notification as in Samsung and other phones (Though there are third party apps to disable it).\n4) Glass in front are back are not corning gorilla glass, and yes it easily gets scratched up.\n5) Many user   s complaints of its random restart during normal usage and during calls, well in my 10 days    usage it did restart once during a call, never after that this happened to me.\n6) Heats up after heavy gaming of more than 15 mins (But to be honest most phone do heat up during heavy gaming). One good thing is, since the phone is not made up of metal it cools down very quickly.\n7) Rear camera is just average. Don   t keep your expectation high. (Don   t get me wrong it   s not bad at all)\n8) I expected more from a 3500 mah battery (Personal opinion)\n9) I have noticed a bug on this phone, the scrolling is not very smooth on this. Also while using Facebook swiping photos left or right is a pain in the ass. Definitely a software patch will sort this thing out.\n10) You will struggle using this mobile under direct sunlight.\n\nCamera review-\nFront camera- Good for selfies and video chat, can record HD videos\nRear camera- Average performance, phone struggles in artificial lights. Great to use in natural lighting\n\nGaming review-\nCan play all the heavy games you can think of without any lag. Tends to heat up after 15 mins of continuous usage, but cools down quickly.\n\nCalling & Network review-\nNo complaints here, good network coverage, good voice quality. Since I   ve switched from Moto E to this phone, many of my friends has noticed a positive change in the voice quality they are hearing.\n\nPerformance review-\nSD 820 chipset with 4GB Ram, do I need to say more. It handles all apps very well. Great memory management with this phone. Most of the apps are in the memory so no loading of apps again and again.\n\nPhone build quality-\nLight weight for a 3500 mah battery. It   s an iPhone in looks. Front and back glass is not from corning. It gets easily scratched up and it   s a finger magnet.\n\nBattery performance-\nCan easily last a whole working day with heavy usage. Charging time 2 hours approx. from 0-100%. Also it comes with an intelligent charge cut (ICC)\n\nSound review-\nDecent output from loudspeaker and headphones.\n\nPS.- Amazon your service was really bad. Took a whole week to get the phone. And the delivery boy was very rude and I had a huge argument with him.\nMy message to Lenovo- Please send an update for extended notification and taking action from the notification panel itself.", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "14 Oct 2016,"], ["Nice phone with very gud features.. worthy product from Lenovo!!", "0 users found this review helpful", "4 stars", "14 Oct 2016,"], ["Fully worst part of mobileAlways hang outN not working properlyThank you", "0 users found this review helpful", "1 stars", "14 Oct 2016,"], ["I got what i expectd nevertheless of the negative comments above..phone is way too classy", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "14 Oct 2016,"], ["This phone is not good, please don't buy from this  site, this phone has many faults", "0 users found this review helpful", "1 stars", "14 Oct 2016,"], ["Courier delivery was super .Gud phone", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "14 Oct 2016,"], ["Phone is amazing but received used product.Warranty status shows only 46 days left", "0 users found this review helpful", "1 stars", "14 Oct 2016,"], ["There is no Air Phone with this packet kindly send us immediate", "0 users found this review helpful", "3 stars", "14 Oct 2016,"], ["Sir,  I have received Lenovo Z2 Plus on 19.07.2017.

Ive used the device fairly extensively, and the lag is minimal. Im not much of a mobile gamer, so havent played any graphics-heavy games. Therefore, cant comment on the graphics. Heating is average, not that extreme.Software is very good, when it comes to performance, but not that fancy themed.Its loaded with features. The customisable home button is extra ordinary. There is also HD screen recording. There is also a multi tasking (split screen) feature which is absent in many phones, and is extremely cool. So, feature-wise it is top notch. In no other phone are there so many useful features. The only issue is there is NO fm radio. Dont know why they took that out??!Camera is decent, and it has a manual mode, where one can play around with the exposure and ISO settings. So, night camera is very good. Since Im not a camera-centric person, Im fine with it.The super charging facility is helpful. In under 1.5 hours, more than 90% charging.Overall, if youre not looking for a camera-centric device, but prioritize performance and features above all else, this is the best device to go for.

You won't notice untill you compare it with other flagship such as Mi 5 or OP3.\nDisplay-I will not say much on this. Its sharp,crisp,vivid and rich.\nCamera-An excellent camera in good lighting but low light photos are not that great but they are also not too bad. And at 18K i think this phone delivers what its expected to deliver. So if you want every thing great add another 10K and get OP3. If your budget is low you won't get better than Z2 Plus\nPerformance-Nothing to say Snapdragon 820-Name is enough.\nBattery-3500 mAh does good job. Gives me proper one say backup in extreme condition. And nearly one and a half in moderate usage.\nFinal verdict-It costs 18K or 20K. Even if you buy the base model also it won't disappoint you if you are not an extreme gamer. And if you want you can add 2K more and get the higher model. I got the base model at 16.5K in The Great Indian Sale via HDFC credit card.And those who say this has not a great camera then bro at 18K you should not compare it with S7 or OP3 or Mi 5 because they all are priced higher. And below 20K some youtubers say G4 plus has better camera but my brother is having G4 plus and trust me they both delivers same  quality images abd infact selfies are better in Z2 Plus.\nSo if you have 18K in your pocket and want to replace it with a smartphone go and get Z2 plus.

I wander, will my next phone have this feature, what if its not that widespread.Finally the speaker is truly Lenovo one, one can feel the bass and vocal oomph in a not so loud mono arrangement.The batteries are noticeably long lasting (reviewing after 1 months of personal usage and based on ZUK community feedback) one full day without worries for moderate to heavy usage. The supplied USB-C charger is quick enough to charge from 5 to 80% within hour whereas one can easily grab a quick-charge 3.0 charger to make it faster (not tested yet).Camera is minimalist but effective, steady and fast.Fingerprint sensor is pretty fast and robust.PS: \"with greater 820 CPU comes greater heating (and cooling)\". Heat is also quickly disseminated via the multi layer metallic roll cage...although at first I thought its not wanted, but quick heating and cooling proved to be a boon for not trapping the heat inside, believe you me. If you have continued reading up to this, you are quite interested in ZUK 2 plus like me, com'n let's not go with the flow and yeah...congratulation in advance!!!And yeah, the phone having a true 2.5D curved front glass, better luck finding a well-fitted tampered glass for extra protection, it will float all around the screen.Did I mention that you can hardly distinguish any pixel as its so densely packed in 5\" display.", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "11 Oct 2016,"], ["GOOD PRODUCT.

My hunt started with Xperia Z3 Compact. Which I have almost bought it from clove.co.uk if not for some customs and shipping problems. So I bought then newly released and brilliantly priced underdog of Xiaomi's Redmi 1S as my temporary device. After that I have been on the hunt for a fairly compact device with top end specs and awesome looks to replace my Redmi 1S. Waited for the Z5 Compact..., It was a Mehhh in design area and you all know the Snapdragon 810 Overheating saga. Looked at the Samsung S6 but it is packed with Exynos and Touchwiz(Which I don't like personally). Looked for the Successor of Oneplus X but it was killed by oneplus. I have never considered any iPhone model from 6 series because they looked little off in design and I felt they are overpriced. So I kept my loyal and sturdy Redmi 1S for a year and kept quiet.\n\n2016 bought a slew of great options like Galaxy S7 and HTC 10, Mi5, Oneplus 3, X Performance and X Compact. Oneplus 3 is little big for my taste. X performance is just a disappointment. X Compact lost its DNA. Mi5 was a design failure. That ugly home button and top and bottom bezels. Ohhh    I just couldn   t bear the sight of it. Xiaomi has taken almost two years to release a successor to Mi4 and screwed it up like anything. And the fact that Xiaomi only sells the basic version of Mi5 in India just made me fuming. So I looked between S7 and HTC 10. HTC 10 got more of my attention because of its build quality, sound output and fluid sense UI.  I have been using Galaxy S7 from last 6 months (which my company allocated it to me to use as a test mule for testing one of our company   s products). Honestly speaking it was build like a tank and has very improved touchwiz, but with some minor hiccups like app crashes here and there and speed throttling while prolonged intense gaming.\nI was about to get HTC 10 which is when I heard about ZUK Z2. Holded my breadth a little longer and waited for it to get released in india.\nAnd here I am. Waited for a week after the release for people to post some reviews on amazon and youtube(just to make sure its is not a complete bummer)  and finally ordered it.\n\nPersonally if you ask me about the phone I would say it is not so bad. It is    actually quite good. Because it has its own cons and Pro   s. Cleanly designed front and back with Silver wording on the back with all black body just looks awesome (you know that and It   s a guy thing). The size is manageable with one hand. The loudness of the speaker on the phone is adequate. The audio output through the 3.5 mm jack is good(better than Galaxy S7). The all glass body is not that strong. Even Lenovo knows that and they compensated it with a free matt case in the box. The display is good and bright enough even for outdoor use and the PPI count is just good enough for day to day media consumption and gaming. The performance is outstanding. Still it can be optimized with OTA updates. Snapdragon 820 just handles every task you through at it with a breeze. 4 GB LPDDR4 ram is more than adequate to your daily needs. And the beefed up 3500 mAH battery will almost get you through One and half to two days. Camera is good in good lighting conditions and the low light performance just average which makes it a mixed bag(I   m not a crazy college girl who takes selfies and smilies for every each hour). The 4K recording is even better than the Oneplus 3(Saw it in video on youtube). The device does not feel anyway as cheap when you hold it in the hand. Actually a lot of colleagues gave props to Lenovo for making such a good looking performance handset for a very low price. I didn   t just buy it because of the price. Its because it ticks a lot of areas in the right manner. All in all  I am quite happy with my purchase and I   m gonna miss my trusty Redmi 1S and fun flavored MIUI.

I had always believed in their customer service. But the dealings I had with Amazon after buying this product broke my trust in Amazon.\n\nFirstly, this phone is just all about specs. You are given a 4.95 inch instead of a 5 inch screen, which already shows Lenovo's mindset. Additionally, the phone is very thick. Whoever said that it felt perfect in their hands, I just wished I hadn't listened to them and bought this phone. The entire phone is a fingerprint magnet and the speaker is average. Also, the claim of Lenovo that the phone will recognize wet fingerprints is total bluff.On top of that the phone shows an error display stating that the phone was incorrectly opened 5 times, just after removing from the pocket. The default chrome app didn't work in my case and there were some stutters while using this phone for the past 8 days.\n\nOn top of that, Amazon's customer service was the worst. It asks you to deal with Lenovo first in case of any technicalities and we ll know Lenovo's customer care. Even if u somehow get a DOA or service denial sheet the ever so gracious Amazon will only replace the product instead of refund because of some stupid policy which has been implemented coincidentally after the phone has launched.\n\nIn short, the phone didn't live up to the hype it generated and if you want to buy it, get it solely for specs.Additionally I feel Amazon's customer service has nosedived towards some pit and I personally am going to stop buying from amazon from hereon, even if its exclusively available here.", "0 users found this review helpful", "1 stars", "07 Oct 2016,"], ["After using for 2 months.Phone is not that much good it has so many problems,power shutdown automatically after 1 or 2 days while calling or doing anything on phone,rear camera stops working sometimes..!!", "0 users found this review helpful", "1 stars", "07 Oct 2016,"], ["Excellent....!", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "07 Oct 2016,"], ["Awesome mobile fast and simple", "0 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "07 Oct 2016,"], ["Lenovo z2 plus is dead hardly after 4 hours pig use.

This is an excellent phone with top specs in its price bracket and though there have been numerous people who appear to have got a bad item my piece has no problems whatsoever. It has the perfect form factor of 5\" which is neither too large nor small and it is very very slick. The apps have absolutely no lag at all and the touch is super responsive. I bought it when it first released so probably that batch had no problems. The storage is 64GB which is mire than enough for my needs as I don't download/store videos and the 4GB ram is the sweet spot for speed and power usage. The battery is superb and I have gone many times without charging for two days in a row and it has held up. The nice chunky bar form is to my taste and many people have confused my phone to be iphone. The Sim tray is little delicate so be careful when using it. The only problem I have come across is that, when it gets too hot outside when I am outdoors it tends to shutdown. It is not frequent but has occurred a few times in my 6 month ownership but I don't think it is a big deal but I think it could be because they have packed a high capacity battery and high spec snapdragon core in such a small size. The display is amazing too and the multifunction home button is very useful to switching rapidly between apps. The rear camera is very good though may be not nearly as good as the ones on MotoZ but the pictures have come out wonderfully when I have gone on trips.

I really did not like large screen phones which are very difficult to hold. This phone comes with 5inch display one of the reasons I bought. I should admit that I did not disappointed with this phone. Everything is not extra ordinary but good. It is not worth comparing this device with other phones. It is good in its own way. Please go through cons N pros from my point of view.\n\nSome common features:\n1) Camera :  Good if there is enough light. If it is very low photos will get more grain.\n2) Screen : OK. Not soo good.\n3) Battery : Last for 1 day with moderate usage . Means no games played and common 4g access.\n\nPros:\n1) Processor\n2) 4GB Ram - This is more than enough to play Injustice\n3) Size - Yes. I wants smaller screen. But it can be more slimmer.\n4) Finger print sensor - Really fast - better than iPhone 5s\n5) Utouch - you configure your functions so that you can use it with single hand\n6) Running very smooth. I did not find any lag while switching apps.\n\nCons:\n1) Can be slimmer - although it is a small screen, still it is bit difficult to hold. Maybe I used to my previous phone which is 4.5 inch.\n2) Bugs - Lenovo known for its Bugs.\n3) Updates - Lenovo release updates very late. Exception to moto phones.\n4) No screen protection - No gorilla glass.\n5) Finger print attractor - that's why they are giving case and matte finish screen guard.\n6) No head phones provided with phone - you have to spend 1200 for skull candy headphones.\n7) No way to control music player if screen is locked. Player shows in Notification bar but you can only control next.\n\nFinal verdict: This is the best of the best phone you will get in this range. If you need more features and you have budget go for Pixel phone or Apple which are above 57000/- which I felt is wasting of soo much money for 2 or 3 meaning less features imo.\n\nPS: Amazon shipping very fast and delivered on Sunday which I am very happy about it. Keep it up.\n\nEdit: After 30 days of usage\n\n1) Heating up some times while charging, and while playing some games\n2) mobile frozen 2 times. Had to hold power button to restart\n3) Lockscreen is less informative and useless. Cannot customize\n4) touch screen is responsive to not only fingers but any body skin. Which sometimes leads to accidental calling.\n5) While on call screen goes off. You cannot hold and open another app. In my case I want to access phone book to view another number.\n6) Cannot snooze or stop alarm while you are on call. The alarm rang while I am call . I have to cut the call to stop alarm sound.\n\nThanks.", "0 users found this review helpful", "4 stars", "06 Oct 2016,"], ["Cheers..!

YouTube video streaming 3 hours a day.\n2) Performance (8/10): Medium Graphic games No issues. All day to day tasks were handled with ease. Snapdragon 820 with 4GB RAM is a BEAST. You don't need 6 GB RAM..\n3) U-touch & Fingerprint scanner (10/10): All expectations met. The U-touch customisation helps you in reducing the use of physical buttons (home & power). Scanner is accurate even when your fingers are slightly wet after workout.\n4) Looks (8/10): Glass Front &amp; Rear gives a premium feel, the device comes with a matte finish rear cover(Same Colour as your smartphone)\n5) Display (8/10): Neat. Good viewing angles.\n6) Camera (Rear/Main) (7/10): 13MP Photos are upto the mark provided you keep your hand steady. But the quality is better than most of them in the price segment.\n7) Camera (Front/Selfie) (8/10): 8MP Photos with proper lighting outweighs other Selfie cameras in this range. 8MP quality is well-maintained, unlike some other budget flagships.\n8) Camera (Video) (7/10): Video Quality is not the best. Slo-Mo 120/240 FPS are understandable the 960 FPS is a gimmick. [Edited on 16th October]\n9) Sound (8/10): Loudspeaker is loud enough, though yu won't get the best quality output. The 3.5mm Jack translates this in better way.  [Edited on 16th October]\n10) Connectivity (WiFi/Bluetooth/4G/Others)(-/10): [Edit after 1month]\n11)UI (-/10): [Edit after 1month]\n12) VR experience (-/10): [Edit after 1month]\n\nAfter 14 days Review: [16th October 2016]\nRead a few reviews/comments, so here are few reasons/solutions to queries posted in other reviews.\n1) RAM usage[Solved]: You have to enable developer options in settings menu Settings>About >ZUI version. Once enabled go to advanced settings>developer options>RAM.\n2) Bluetooth connectivity[Reason]: When connecting to Car infotainment systems the phone auto-disconnects, this is because the System tries to access your phonebook, for security reasons the phone auto-disconnects itself.\nThere's no way to fix this for now, Expected to be fixed in coming updates.(if anyone of you have fixed this kindly comment below)\n3)Heating (Solved): Update your phone, the latest update has fixed this. And all phones heat up when you use it while you are charging it. Heavy games heats up all phones. If your charger heats up, move to other point your switch board might be having issues.\n\nAfter 1 Month Review: Coming Soon(2nd November)\n\nVERDICT\nVerdict: Snapdragon 820 with 4GB@'19999, what else do you want??

Battery draining like anything. Amazon looting people by seeking these dabbas and collecting money from people.......", "0 users found this review helpful", "1 stars", "05 Oct 2016,"], ["Much has been said about this device. About how the hardware is top of the line, how the phone is snappy and fast, how affordable this is for top of the line specs, etc.\nThere are many things good about this phone. Such as its almost top of the line specs, its compact size, its fast finger print sensor. But the things that are bad about this device bring overall worth of this device down considerably.\n\nLet's start with issues regarding hardware that might be specific to the device I received only.\n\n1. No Gorilla Glass. Well there goes most of your attention that could otherwise be diverted to more important things in life. Even though Lenovo touts of putting 2.5D Glass or something like that, it ain't Gorilla Glass and we don't know how this revolutionary 2.5D glass is going to perform.\n2. Below par camera performance. Granted, for 20K device, I didn't expect Galaxy S7 tier camera but I did not expect Moto E tier camera. Low light shots are bad enough; daylight shots this device takes are substandard as well.\n3. Accuracy of Fingerprint sensor. The sensor is fast. Crazy fast. But it is also inaccurate. Sometimes when the device is in pocket and you take it out, you cannot unlock it right away. Turns out you have pressed the sensor more than 5 times even though you have not touched it.\n\nNow comes the part where I have major issues with this device. Software. The only thing making this device worth was its supposedly top of the line hardware. It's all downhill after that.\n\n1. ZUI is a bastard child of MIUI that did not inherit its good features. Though it's based on 6.0.1, it should have been better had they released this with vanilla version of Android.\n2. Settings are poorly organized. Why are battery, app, storage and hotspot setting under Advanced Settings category? These are the basic features and they have their dedicated settings in stock Android. Why does Lenovo think it's better to juggle them into different sub-menu?\n3. If you need to know how much RAM some application is taking up, good luck! There is no option for that.\n4. You cannot set different ringtones for different SIMs. A feature that is basic in ROM that ZUI has blatantly copied.\n5. One of the biggest features of Android is Actionable Notifications. You don't need to go to app to take actions on notifications. It can be done from Notification Centre itself. Well, it is entirely absent from ZUI. I cannot change tracks or turn off music from music player app. I cannot reply to any message from notification for apps that support this feature.\n6. Also it is painfully slow when it comes to selecting SIM while you are trying to place a call. In case of emergency, have another phone handy from which you can place call to emergency numbers.\n7. Toggles can be accessed from bottom of the screen. Whoever thought of copying this feature from iOS should be fired immediately.\n8. Want to change lock screen wallpaper? Oops, you can't! Because our revolutionary developers considered this option beneath them so they did not include it in software.\n9. Turn on Do not Disturb mode which is named No Disturbing here. Yet anybody or anything can disturb you. You get calls, messages and notifications from all callers and apps.\n10. New bug I discovered recently, even if you turn off mobile data and WiFi, you internet connection still works. I don't know if this is some kind of wizardary but if this phone somehow connects to internet without getting charged for data use, this truly is revolutionary.\n\nOne thing that also bugs the hell out of me is you cannot place any return or replacement for this order. You need to get DoA certificate from Lenovo to return or replace this phone. And we all know how wonderful Lenovo's support staff is about this! I understand that Amazon does not want to face losses from numerous returns, but to completely put the power into the hands of manufacturer is wrong. Even an option to replace this phone with any other device of customer's choosing should be fine.\n\nIf you are on this page and reading this, run for your life! This device ain't worth the trouble. If you want something that works, get a cheaper device such as Moto G4 Plus, Redmi Note 3. And if you want a power packed device, get OnePlus 3.\nI am one of the many who fell for the specifications hype around this phone and is now paying the price.

I have used OnePlus 3 for few days, and that thing is a beast. But the comparing Z2 with Oneplus 3 would not be a fair. Z2 is a champion in its price bracket, and it achieves it by stuffing an awesome processor,.more than enough RAM, but a little cheap looking body.Performance: SD 820, 4 GB RAM, do I have to say more? The phone is quiet snappy. It can handle multiple heavy applications at once. I am not a gamer, but I did download some heavy games just to test this thing, and nope, not a stutter, or frame drops, whatsoever. The phone just doesn't give up..:PScreen: Coming from the Samsung Galaxy family, I was quite used to the super sharp AMOLED panels. In that sense the screen on Z2 has little to offer, but it will do the job well.Camera: Can snap some good pictures in daylight, but in low light, it is bit noisy.OS: Well, there are few people slightly unhappy about the OS experience, but I find it perfect for me. It is kind of stock Andriod, with few (company) apps installed. But the best part, unlike other brands is, you can totally uninstall all the unwanted apps without having to root.Battery: Quite reliable 3500mAH, but you have to ration the power quite well. With few calls, active online messaging, few videos on YouTube, and occasional gaming takes me to about 10% at the end of the day.Other issues: Non as such, except notification light... it just doesn't exist..:(Should you buy it? ..

It looks like a premium phone and the build quality is great.\n2. The phone comes with back protective cover, pre-applied screen guard which are of good quality\n3. Given 4GB of RAM and Snapdragon 820, processing is very fast and there were no lags when multitasking.\n4. Battery life is very good. Battery % now reduced to 35 from 100 after 1day of high usage(inserted 2 4G sim cards, 4G ON for almost 10hours, listened to music for about 2hrs, played games for an hour approx.)\n5. U touch button is very handy(can be customized) - I liked the feature of switching between apps on swiping the button left/right.\n6. Finger print scanner is very fast.\n7. Inbuilt U health app that keeps track of health is handy. You need not buy a smartwatch unless u wish not to lose track of your activities even for a minute.\n8. Front camera takes amazing photos(8MP).\n9. Rear camera supports 4k recording and the quality of the video was great.\n10. Audio quality is pretty good (not that good compared to vibe x3).\n\nCons:\n1. 13MP Rear camera does not justify the cost of the phone. This type of camera can be found in phones with pricing <10k. There was no much difference between this and my old Redmi 1s camera. (But i rarely use camera, so its not issue for me)\n2. Phone heats up when playing games for more than 15mins. I played Traffic rider, Dr. Driving (both of which are not high end games) and the phone heated up within 15mins of gaming. There was no heating when browsing for more than 30mins.\n3. There is no quick charge adapter included even though the phone supports quick charge.\n4. I could not figure out a way to block the calls, not sure if it has. Let me know if anyone finds out a way to do it.\n5. Sound recorder is below average.\n\nI would say for those of you who do not care much about the camera and not into too much of gaming, this phone is a great buy.

It helps a lot guys. Here is the full, detailed review :\nReasons to Buy Lenovo Z2 Plus (Pros or Positives):\n\n1. Without any doubt the firs is the processor which is the 2.15 GHz Quad-core Snapdragon 820 chipset.\n\n2. For graphics and especially for gaming its powered by Adreno 530 GPU.\n\n3. It comes with a 4 GB DDR4 RAM which is 50% faster in comparison to the DDR3 one.\n\n4. Next Lenovo Z2 Plus pros is that the internal memory comes with 64 GB for user data storage.\n\n5. Supports VoLTE with both the SIM card slots. And yes it does supports Reliance Jio 4G internet service.\n\n6. The camera has the ability to record 4K resolution videos.\n\n7. The operating is the latest version of Android Marshmallow v6.0.1 which is stuffed with a clean ZUI 2.0 user interface.\n\n8. The fingerprint sensor on the front panel is very fast in responding, takes about less than 0.2 seconds. Plus the fingerprint scanner can unlock wet fingers too.\n\n9. The home button has the U-Touch 2.0 feature to perform seven different functions. For instance a single touch will take you back, long touch will open notification center, swipe left or right will open recent apps, single press will take to home, double press will open app switcher, long press will open Google Now. And last is of course the fingerprint sensor.\n\n10. Another Lenovo Z2 Plus pros is that the U-Health inbuilt app keeps track of your footsteps taken, distance traveled, and calories burnt. It essentially acts as a fitness tracker.\n\n11. For display protection the screen is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 3.\n\n12. It has a USB Type-C reversible connector for charging and data syncing.\n\n13. Yes, it also supports USB OTG cable.\n\n14. The 3500 mAh battery capacity is large enough to last more than a day.\n\n15. It also has a fast battery charging technology Quick charge 3.0 which can charge up to 83% in just under 30 minutes.\n\n16. All the essential sensors are present. They are gyroscope, eCompass (magnetometer), accelerometer, ambient light sensor (for adaptive brightness), hall sensor (proximity sensor) and distance sensor (pedometer).\n\n17. The body material is a premium chamfered metal on the edges and Corning Gorilla Glass front and back panel with anti-oil and anti-fingerprint magnet feature.\n\nReasons Not to Buy Lenovo Z2 Plus (Cons, Negatives or Drawbacks):\n\n1. For this price tag the 5 inch screen is definitely a very small display for both media consumption and as a smartphone in general.\n\n2. Next Lenovo Z2 Plus cons or demerits is that the contrast ratio of the full HD display is lower than 900:1 which is means the black are not too black to distinguish from grey.\n\n3. There is no memory card slot. If you buy the 64 GB it is OK but the 32 GB model is a huge compromise for internal memory.\n\n4. The phone is a bit on the thicker side at 8.5 mm, currently the average smartphone have a thickness between 7.5 to 7.8\n\n5. Other than the home button there in no dedicated navigational touch buttons below the screen. All are placed on the already small size screen.\n\n6. Another Lenovo Z2 Plus cons or drawbacks is that the 13 megapixel primary camera is a huge letdown with a smaller f/2.2 focal aperture.\n\n7. Lenovo says that its has EIS (electronic image stabilization), but the truth is that EIS is available with almost all smartphones phones and it doesn't help much in stabilization. The real important missing part with the camera is the OIS (optical image stabilization) feature.\n\n8. There is also no infrared for IR blaster which could have been used for wireless control of TV, AC and other home appliances.\n\n9. And the last Lenovo Z2 Plus cons or negative is that NFC (near field communication) is absent.", "0 users found this review helpful", "3 stars", "30 Sep 2016,"], ["Works like a Charm with SD 820 performance.

Order them along with the phone. Case is included by the way.\n8. Lenovo has released kernel sources for Zuk Z2 which is same as our Indian Z2 Plus. So there are plenty of opportunities to develop custom ROMS.\n9. Separate USB-C and headphone port. I can listen to music and charge it simultaneously.\n\nNegatives:\n1. Why do Lenovo have to slap this ZUI? This just spoils the entire experience and is the biggest weak point of this phone.\n2. Setting a simple wallpaper is a difficult task. You get the idiotic square wallpaper on the lockscreen.\n3. LTE Band 28 which is in the upcoming spectrum auctions is not there in this phone. So definitely not future proof. If you are expert in rooting/following internet guides, then you can unlock band 28 but no guarantee that it will work.\n4. Phone heated up after first boot. It tends to remain slightly warm with heavy game use.\n5. No Quick Charge 3. I called up customer care and this has been confirmed by them. S820 supports QC3 but Lenovo cheapened out on the circuitry and did not give us this speedy charging technology. We are stuck with regular slow charging. I swear I read here on Amazon promotional material that this phone supports Quick charge 3.0. I bought it specifically for quick charging. Now all of a sudden this phone does not support that. WTF man!!\n6. Wifi ac is single band and NOT dual band as falsely advertised before. You will get max 433 Mbps connection speed on 5 Ghz ac band.\nI fell a victim of false advertising.\n\nLenovo is also using software fuse. If you unlock the bootloader and re-lock it, your phone is tagged as re-locked and OTA updates stop working. The updater app in it's poor English says \"No OTA for you because you are root\" This clearly means the warranty is over the moment you unlock bootloader to install custom ROMs or to root.\n\nOverall, this is a ok phone for the price. The 64 GB space (52 GB usable) is far better than competing rivals. Lenovo should give us stable pure AOSP ROM. This will make the phone unbeatable. My suggestion: Buy but only after checking out options like Mi5, One Plus 3, ZTE Axon.", "0 users found this review helpful", "3 stars", "30 Sep 2016,"], ["Edit 1:\nReview after one month of usage:\n1) No VoLTE (It is enabled in SIM Settings but not usable),\n2) Mobile gets stuck all of a sudden (atleast once in two days) without any load/ notice. We need to observe it so not to loose any communication.\n3) Heats heavily without bg apps/usage\nWhen you are not working on mobile it looks like: attached video, if you are working on it: Screen is hung. In either case, notification led is ON, heats extensively. you can't operate unless U hard restart by holding power button 20 sec.\nWhat I have done in this month:\nSettings>Reset 4 times.\nStuck abruptly, Restart once in 2 days.\nI called customer support but no use.\nI reset it for 4 times now from advice of Lenovo service call support & Amazon service support\nFelt Amazon.in hopeless for its support: No responsibility for Exclusive/ Prime. No contact details of Lenovo local service/ Seller too.\nDisagreed to return and had been rude. Called them 4 times and chatted for 3 times. For lenovo mobile service center they are asking to check \"Google/JustDial\"\nGuys: No VoLTE Support too. Option is enabled in SIM Settings but unable to use it (Jio SIM is working only for Data, using JioJoin for Calls).\n\nInitial Review:\n======================================================================\nIt is a good solid mobile, Pros & Cons as follows:\nIt has \"Pros\":\n1) Snapdragon 820 Chipset with 4 GB RAM\n2) No lags or heat issues till now\n3) Good Software/ Interfacing (ZUI 2.0)\n4) Looks solid\n\nYet has lots of \"Cons\":\nFeature wise:\n1) No Multi-Color Notification LED, for allocating to multiple application notifications\n2) No Radio (FM/AM)\n3) No Quick Charger 3.0 adapter not provided. Not Charging 100% even after 2 hr.\n4) No expandable memory slot\nCamera: 5) No OIS & lot of noice, even with primary camera\nConnectivity: 6) No NFC\n7) No 4G support for Second(Slot) SIM\nNot Premium looking:\n8) Bulky ~1cm thick design & greater than 170 gm, with case provided. (Feels bulky even without it)\n9) Only 70% of Body:Screen ratio\n10) Defected stealth case, in the box (not perfect fit)\n\nConclusion: I feel this is \"OK\" mobile with cost, could have better as described (Camera is disappointing, on par with K4 Note). Quick Charging is waste without Adapter.\nIf you are \"Fine\", with bulkier mobile with small screen. This suites you.\n======================================================================\n\nNone are not taking responsibility:\na) Amazon(being Prime User/ being Exclusive product/ no Seller contact),\nb) Seller(emailed but no reply),\nc) Lenovo Mobile.\n\nReview after 1 month of usage.

Amazon is not ready to even replace it.", "0 users found this review helpful", "1 stars", "30 Sep 2016,"], ["I bought it in October 2016, after 3 months of usage, I can say that the device delivers for what its worth.1 - Performance is what you'd generally expect from a Snapdragon 820 device. Smooth and lag less performance. All heavy games run without any hassle.2 - Battery is good too. You can get around a day of battery with casual usage which includes light gaming, browsing using 4g cellular data, etc. I get around 6-7 hours SOT.3 - Camera is average, nothing exceptional here. This device wasn't built as a camera centric device anyway. So don't buy it if camera is your priority. Oh, and almost forgot, the stock camera app does not have manual mode, which was extremely disappointing for me.4 - UI is okay-ish. Not too good, not too bad. You get Google Launcher pre-installed on Indian variant.5 - Software is ZUK's ZUI. The Chinese variant and Indian variant both use different versions of ZUI, and there is no clear information about the update cycle on Indian ZUI. Chinese ZUI is rumored to get Nougat this week (3rd week of Jan). However, there is no information about when will Indian ZUI get it. I don't think ZUK/Lenovo is gonna deliver on the software side considering the amount of time that they're taking to roll out Nougat.So now the Verdict : If you want a fast performing device which can handle almost everything you throw at it, and you're okay with a casual camera and don't really care much about updates, then this is the device for you.However, if you need a good camera, then I would suggest checking out the Moto G4 Plus or the Coolpad Cool1.
