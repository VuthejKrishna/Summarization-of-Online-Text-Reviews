Compared to the X that this would be replacing, it seemed like a very mild update, and not worth the entry price! However on actual use of this phone, it just shows that all the little improvements taken TOGETHER add up to a brilliant update. First off this just seems much quicker in use, from FaceID unlock to opening apps and swiping, there is no hesitation. I went for the new Forest Green colour also, which is also very nice. The phone feels nice in the hand. Now for the camera:The main reason for upgrading! Just wow! I know other smart phone manufacturers all have great cameras on their flagship phones but again, in use these new cameras and sensors and software on the iPhone 11 Pro, are incredible for taking great photos quickly and easily. The super-wide lens- 13mm (35mm equiv) is great for landscapes and interiors. And the normal (26mm) and \"telephoto\" lens (only 56mm I think) are very sharp and great for taking portraits in \"portrait mode\" where it blurs the background nicely.The effect can be altered post capture amongst many other things in the iPhone camera software. The selfie camera is also updated to 12 MP so much sharper than before. The \"Night Mode\" feature is truly black magic! With only minimal light, this tiny camera/phone that fits in your pocket can take photos at night that it almost makes it look as if taken in day light and is full of crisp detail. Incredible.In a few years there will not be much point in owning \"proper cameras!\" looking at the rate of progression of these smart phone cameras. And oh yes, you can make great phone calls on this device as well as all the other things we take for granted now (internet browsing, social media, online banking which is the most secure on the iPhone).

At first , i decided to get the iPhone 11, but truly, i would have regretted that decision. Bought this finally. I have been using this device for a few days now, and i am writing a review based on what i feel. nnAt first, Getting the device on hand made me feel it\u2019s kind of a bit heavy than the old iPhone 8 plus or the Xs Max. The look and design of the phone gives a premium feel in hand.  The display is awesome, and so is the screen resolution. The three camera module captures fantastic images, and it is great for wide angle photography. Speaking of camera, i have noticed, the camera holds the color of the images both in wide angle or telephoto shots, which doesnt seem to happen with other devices.nnNot to mention, the night mode of the iPhone 11 pro max has been drastically improved and it really clicks great images in low light conditions which is impressive! The iOS 13 adds butter to the phone\u2019s UI. Performance wise, there is no issues which i have faced using iPhones these years. The A13 Bionic chip is super efficient and really consumes battery intelligently. nnI think the phone is little over priced, but its okay when you want to have such a premium device in hand. nI\u2019m satisfied with the performance it provides, and I\u2019m completely fit in Apple\u2019s eco system. nnHope this review helps,nnThank you.. \ud83d\ude01", "2 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "17 Oct 2019,"], ["had to sell my kidney but you gotta do, what you gotta do!", "2 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "06 Oct 2019,"], ["Great photos", "2 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "04 Oct 2019,"], ["Better experience than Andriod, but some things need to be changed.

Charging is really fast.Sound and Video Quality: Sound of external speaker is really loud but the quality is missing somehow.Camera and photography: This was probably the most advertised part, prior to release.

If you want a phone ONLY for looks buy this one. NOT for anything else. Let me start with the box. The phone was loosely packed inside a box which was slightly crushed. Check Geeky Ranjiths video on internet and his unboxing video will show you exactly what I am talking about. I think the first batch was packed and shipped in a hurry with NO quality check. Even the charger had scratches on it. Many people have complained about the same.Coming to the phone, the build quality is really good. Display is great and battery life is also good. Camera is good for this price point. That's all I have to say for the good points.And now, Performance....slow is not the word. NO performance is what I am seeing. WhatsApp also has to be opened manually to refresh and get new messages. Can a phone get worse than this????? Okay, the Outlook, its doesnt even load your mail box. I tried reset, restart and refresh and what not. Simple apps like Phone, PayTM and even the SMS Inbox will crash when you are just using it!!!

Have seen reviews in youtube and other gadget sites and then decided to go for this baby.\n\nPros\n\n1. Good looks and slik design. The curve in the sides makes it looks awesome . \n2. Both physical and virtual keyboard works extremely well and can be used simultaneously.\n3. Recent update from Lollipop to Marshmallow has rapidly increased mobile and specially battery performance. The same will also help in decreasing heating of the Device.\n4. Processing power with Qualcomm Processor is upto the mark and application lag time is not very high.\n5. Certain features like productivity tab, quick widget, battery indicator bar in curved area is really makes this phone much user friendly.\n\nCons\n\n1. Front camera is not what current smartphones will accept. 2mpx front camera is far too acceptable. Back camera is ok with respect to resolution but shutter speed is very high with respect to other cheapest phones even.\n2. Battery heating is a issue which can be somewhat solved by upgrading to Marshmallow but not full. The device gets pretty warm on extensive use of apps or to much multi function.\n3. The inbuilt charger which comes bundle is very specific with respect to charging and you may find some plug points refuse to charge the device. \n4. Battery takes pretty much time to fully charge though not sure about its performance with a Qualcomm Quick Charger 2.0 as the same is not bundled.\n\nAs a whole the device is pretty much good to go with except for some features.

The major point which I've noticed is, the power transmission is bi-directional in this. You can charge your mobile from your laptop and vice versa. It's charging my mobile quickly without heating it. Google about USB-C to know more about this.\n2. Corner-less display - Don't remove this mobile from your choice only for the reason it doesn't have full HD display. You'll really feel luxurious with it's corner-less display itself. Display quality is good compared to other HD display phones in the market.\n3. Smoothness - The UI is sooo smooth to work with. I really enjoy it. It's giving me a feel like I'm holding a 50K phone in my hands.\n4. 23MP rear camera - I didn't use camera in the past two days. I'll post about it later.\n\nDisadvantages:-\n1. Fingerprint sensor is missing - Many of the new models at this price range is coming up with fingerprint sensor for the enhanced security. Sony have to note this point.

Themes from play store is also good\nCons:\n1.

Battery easily lasts more than a day in moderate usage, even heavy usage it lasts up to 12 hour. Ultra stamina mode is cool.  Fast charging works really well. \n2. Lots of customization available for keyboard and camera. \n3. The 23 Mp produces good low light photo. In day light the image quality is good, though you need to hold the mobile steady to get that shot. When it comes to cloudy or mixed lighting situation the image quality varies with every snap and it's weird. Front camera is ok, nothing exciting. \n4. Sound is ok nothing great about it, previously I had Xperia  U which produses better sound than this one. I am surprised to see that sony is still supplying the same old headphones.  \n5. Performance is ok no lag whatsoever. \n\nCons: This phone looks great on paper but is unable to deliver. Certainly not worth if you are paying 20K.\n1. Touch of this phone is not as responsive especially on the edges of the phone. \n2. Front camera is not good and wide angle is not wide enough ;)  Image quality is just ok.

( No earphones included )\n\n*My Personal Configuration*\nI'm using the phone with the out of the box matte guards, back and front as it feels amazing in hand. Haven't removed the back sticker, to avoid any kinds of scratches on the glass back and put the cover on top.\nReceived a ZUK UI update as soon as I connected to Wi-Fi.\nGoogle Now launcher works flawlessly on this, along with the ZUK UI Skin which makes it flaunt the buttery smooth android experience.\nUninstalled any kinds of bloatwares, although there were hardly 3-4 apps.\nDisabled the on screen home, back and app tray buttons and using it completely without clicking any button at all.\nThe U-Touch to swipe left or right for switching along the apps quickly and efficiently, touching the button for back, long touch for displaying all open apps, double click for camera, long click for notifications bar, single click for direct home access.\nNever clicking the lock or home button, just using the quick switch button (swiping from below the screen).\nBattery lasts me one full working day with around 15-25% left (4G on all the time, 2-3hrs Wifi, with screen on time for more than 6 hours).\n\n\n*PROS*\n1) Absolute lag-less experience. No issues with performance at all. Fluidic switching between apps (even games).\n2) Amazing fingerprint scanner (To be very frank, I've tested OnePlus3 too; and I found Z2 Plus  is faster. Gets faster as you keep using it).\n3) Sound output through 3.5mm jack is just crystal clear. For an Audiophile like me, Treble output was decent,  Bass was amazing. The Speaker was decent enough; easily heard in outside crowd conditions (Although I rarely use the speakers).\n4) UHealth app works fairly accurately, Pedometer sensor is pretty good.\n5) U-Touch option is one of its kind (Best feature)\n6) The 4G speeds on this is just amazing. (Apparently, I found that its always active on the 4G bandwidth so whenever I switch on data it displays all the messages instantly).\n7) The charging rate is pretty fast too, takes around 2hr 15mins on an average to charge.\n8) 5inch form-factor is wonderful, and just what I wanted.\n9) Looks like an iPhone Jet Black series due to the backside glass.\n10) Double Tap to wake is an awesome feature.\n\n*CONS*\n1) No arguments, as other reviewers have stated too; the camera falls off in low lit conditions. Does a decent job in outside daylight. (Both front and rear).\n2) I found that Google Keyboard (Gboard) is making the device lag while typing on keyboard ( Yes, I almost fainted ). But it's probably due to the new update  and the lag only appears very RARELY and that too doesn't affect other device performances (switching and using other apps). Only happens in the gboard while typing.\n3) The notification light was one huge backdrop for me personally since it's only a single white light LED on top right, which is usually not visible at certain angles but is very bright when viewed face front and around. Although you can change whether the light blinks or stays constantly lit.\n\n*My Personal Opinion*\nThere were many critical reviews about the heating issue this device has, but I found nothing which is out of the ordinary. Playing heavy games, yes sure the heating is kind of accentuated by the black body of the device, although is not a huge issue since it's particularly present in almost all the devices of this era. I'm using it for a college lifestyle; using it for sometime in direct bright sunlight causes it to heat up a bit which is very normal.\nI guess some of the devices which are present are faulty or maybe just due to consumer based usage.\n\nIn the end, clearly the PROS outweigh the CONS by a huge margin.\nDefinitely the best Smartphone device in under 20K range.\nSnapdragon 820, Adreno 530, 441ppi screen display. All under 20k.\nEnough said.\n\nAlternative to OnePlus3?\nAbsolutely.", "7 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "18 Mar 2017,"], ["Phone is not wprth buying Poor Battery backup and charges too slow. \nFurther I noticed the UI is not that good. \nYou have to put on cover everytime. \nPerformance is not upto mark \nCamera is good in Daylight and sucks in Low Lighting conditions.", "7 users found this review helpful", "1 stars", "02 Mar 2017,"], ["Not Meeting Expectation at all on performance front.

Here's what I think:\n\nThe build quality is kinda downgrade if you ask me. I am a fan of metal body build and do not care about wireless charging. So this glass build scares me a bit. It is also a tad heavier than OG Pixel  XL.\n\nDisplay is absolutely stunning. Notch doesn't bother me much and I may disable it if Google implements disabling of the notch in such a way that the status bar icon stays there.\n\nCameras (both front and rear) are just awesome. The wide angle front camera helps a lot if you want to fit in more people in your selfies. The camera app still doesn't have Night Sight just yet. Have not played around with it much.\n\nI just missed the stereo speaker from my Nexus 6P and the speaker on this one is quite loud. As reported by many P3XL users, if you play anything with higher volume you can literally feel it's vibration on the back of the device. The speakers are not balanced which is understandable due to the different sized speaker grills. I have no other reported issues with the speaker i.e. crackling noises, buzzing/clicking sounds etc.\n\nThe OS is fluid enough and since I have not used the phone extensively just yet, I am yet to see the widely reported RAM management issues. Right now it's smooth, fluid with zero lag. Surprisingly, the OS is on September patch which is kinda downgrade from my OG Pixel XL which was running the October patch. Don't know why they didn't push the September patch. My guess is they're concentrating more on fixing the bugs.\n\nBattery life seems to decent too. Charged it fully around 10 hours ago. 2 hours of Screen on time with 60% left.\n\nYet to check the audio from USB-C  to 3.5mm dongle but since it comes with the upgraded dongle it should be fine I guess. I do miss the 3.5mm jack though. Also planning to get the Apple USB-C  to 3.5mm dongle as a backup since it is reported to work fine with Pixel devices and is quite cheap for $9.\n\nAll in all pretty satisfied with the device.  I don't think I can use a non Pixel device now.", "8 users found this review helpful", "5 stars", "02 Nov 2018,"], ["Writing this review after 15 days of use. nFirst thing is Google the brand itself is enough to buy this mobile without second thought. Now coming to the pros n cons of this mobile.nPros : nCamera - Just awesome. It works as per the expectation. Far better than any iPhone camera. Landscape mode is superb. And the one of the hidden feature of the this pixel is that it creates AI photo from your gallery by itself. Which is just awesome. ( Attached one sample pic here)nStock Android - Seamless experience. Does everything very smoothly and without any lag.nScreen -  Best in class.nBattery - Lasts almost 24 hrs based on your uses. nExtra feature - You have some extra and cool features like swapping between running apps. Google assistant wakes up by pressing the side of the phone. Works pretty well. Although you can increase or decrease it as per convenient.nLook - Just flawless. Looks awesome. The back side they have one third glossy finish which feels good in hand.nNotch - Looks ok but all the applications don't support this. It happens in all the mobile though.nSpeaker \ud83d\udd0a - You have got 2 speakers top n bottom. Which works very well. Sound is more than enough for mobile phone.nYou don't get 2 speakers in most of the smart phones. nFinger print scanner- Works like champ. nUnlimited Storage for your pics n videos.nnnCons-n Only C type port for both charging n headphones.
